# Definition
Variable Renewable Energy (VRE) refers to a source of renewable energy that offers an uncertain amount of energy as an output for a forecast time period. This is sometimes referred to as `non-firm capacity`.

As a general guide, the typical reliability of a `firm` supplier of energy would be at least 95%. Any electricity generating machine that is less than 95% reliable for a forecast time interval (e.g. 30 minutes) would be considered `non-firm capacity`.
