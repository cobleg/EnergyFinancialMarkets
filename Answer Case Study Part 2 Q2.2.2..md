Decoupling of LNG netback prices and domestic gas prices occurred in 
LNG prices moderated since October 2022 due to normalisation of the Russia-Ukraine war and moderation in the Japanese LNG market.

Domestically, there were several factors that kept domestic gas prices lower:
- Gas produced in Australia is subject to the Heads of Agreement, which requires uncontracted gas to first be offered with reasonable notice on competitive market terms to the Australian domestic market.
- Producer offer prices fell to around $20/GJ from a peak of $40/GJ. Increased competition due to the higher than historical average gas prices likely placed downward pressure on offers.
- Introduction of the price cap perhaps increasing pressure on gas producers to contain price offers.
