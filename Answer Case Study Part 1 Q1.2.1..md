## Risks
### Operational risks
(1) Forced outage of wind farm due to wind dropping causing generation to operate below full capacity. This leaves Green Energy short relative to its expected load. Green Energy would need to purchase the difference from the wholesale spot market.

(2) Expected load implies some variation, which could lead to an 'over-hedged' position, being forced to pay for energy it doesn't use. Green Energy will need to offer this surplus to the wholesale market, which may not reach the PPA price over the surplus period. This leaves a net expense.

### Financial risks
1. Suspension of the wholesale electricity market, which imposes the administered price cap. 
2. Assuming Green Energy is offering fixed price and volume contracts to its customers, it could be exposed to unexpected losses due to a loss of PPA volume or a loss of customers.
3. Counter-party risk with respect to its wind farm supplier via the PPA agreement or with one or more of Green Energy's customers defaulting on contracts.
4. For the amount of deficit or surplus energy, Green Energy is exposed to spot price variation which could impose financial loss.
