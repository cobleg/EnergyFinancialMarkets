# Overview
A cap is a financial agreement in which one party agrees to pay the difference between the spot price at a pre-determined market interval and a given strike price multiplied by a predetermined quantity. Another name for a cap is a *[call option](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/trading-investing/call-option/)*.

The payment from the cap seller to the capbuyer is defined as:

$$ Cap(P,X,S,P_c) = \begin{cases} (S-P)X+P_cX & P \ge S \\
P_cX & P < S
\end{cases} $$
where
$P$ is the uncertain spot price
$S$ is the strike price
$X$ is the quantity multiplier
$P_c$ is the cap premium

In words, this equation says that the cap buyer will receive a payment from the cap seller less the cap premium originally paid
