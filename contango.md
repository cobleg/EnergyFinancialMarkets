The futures price curve is said to be in contango when the **expected future spot price** is less than the forward price. Also, futures prices are higher than the current spot price.

## Indicators of contango
- The `expected spot price` is less than the `futures price` for a given future expiry date for the same asset. 
- Upward sloping forward price curve beginning from the `observed spot price`. Each successive `futures price` is greater than the previous `futures price`.

## Expected versus observed spot price
Terminology is confusing! The `expected spot price` is a concept that cannot be observed or verified by observation. Rather, it is inferred from a model of futures prices.
