The futures price curve is said to be in contango when the `expected spot price` is less than the forward price. Also, futures prices are higher than the `current spot price`.

## Indicators of contango
- The `expected spot price` is more than the `futures price` for a given future expiry date for the same asset. 
- Upward sloping forward price curve beginning from the `current spot price`. Each successive `futures price` is greater than the previous `futures price`.

## Expected versus current spot price
Terminology is confusing! The `expected spot price` is a concept that cannot be observed or verified by observation. Rather, it is inferred from a model of futures prices. By contrast, the `current spot price` is observed. The interest from a trader perspective is the relationship between the `current spot price` against the `expected spot price`. The slope of the futures curve can be informative. For example, when the futures price is assumed to represent the `expected spot price`.
