# Overview
> Cashflow at Risk (CFaR) provides a summary statistic of the risk inherent in the firm's portfolio of cash flows. The CFaR measure provides a summary statistic of the risk inherent in the firm’s portfolio of cash flows. It essentially represents the shortfall of cash flow, associated with a certain probability, a company could experience over a certain time period. Such a modelling effort can be helpful in managing the firm’s operating cash flow and provide a sense of the firm’s overall liquidity risk over a certain time period (Jankensgard, 2008).
