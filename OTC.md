Over the Counter markets trade securities via a broker-dealer network instead of via a centralised exchange such as the [[ASX]].

OTC markets offer specialised derivative products that are not available via an exchange. Consequently, OTC markets could be less liquid and more expensive for equivalent products. However, the cost may be less costly than absorbing the underlying risk or adopting a physical risk management strategy.
