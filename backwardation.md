**Backwardation** is a market condition where the current price of an asset (spot price) is higher than the prices for futures contracts of the same asset. In other words, futures prices decrease with longer maturities. This situation is typically contrasted with **[[contango]]**, where futures prices are higher than the current spot price.

Another way of looking at this is to consider the **expected future spot price**. In this case, the futures price is less than the expected future spot price.

### Key Characteristics of Backwardation

1. **Spot Price > Futures Price**
   - The current price of the commodity or asset is higher than the price agreed for future delivery.

2. **Downward Sloping Forward Curve**
   - The futures price curve slopes downward as you move further into the future. This means that futures prices decrease as the contract maturity increases.

3. **Market Expectations**
   - Backwardation often occurs when the market expects the price of the asset to decrease over time. This can be due to various reasons such as anticipated increases in supply, decreases in demand, or seasonal factors.

### Example

Assume the spot price of oil is $80 per barrel. If the futures prices for oil are:
- 1-month futures contract: $78 per barrel
- 3-month futures contract: $75 per barrel
- 6-month futures contract: $72 per barrel

This pricing structure indicates a backwardation market because the spot price ($80) is higher than the futures prices, which decline over time.

### Causes of Backwardation

1. **Supply and Demand Imbalances**
   - Immediate supply shortages or high current demand can drive up the spot price, while future supply is expected to ease these pressures, leading to lower futures prices.

2. **Convenience Yield**
   - The convenience yield is the benefit or premium associated with holding the physical commodity rather than the derivative or futures contract. High convenience yield can lead to backwardation, as market participants are willing to pay more for immediate access to the commodity.

3. **Storage Costs**
   - When storage costs are high, it can lead to backwardation. Traders might prefer to sell futures rather than store the commodity, which reduces future prices.

4. **Interest Rates and Carry Costs**
   - If the cost of carrying or holding an asset is lower than the cost implied by futures prices, it can result in backwardation.

### Implications of Backwardation

1. **Profit Opportunities for Arbitrageurs**
   - Arbitrageurs can potentially profit from buying the asset at the spot price and selling futures contracts, expecting to deliver the asset at the future date for a higher spot price.

2. **Inventory Management**
   - Producers and consumers of commodities might adjust their inventory management strategies based on the expectation of lower future prices.

3. **Hedging Strategies**
   - Backwardation impacts hedging strategies for market participants, as it indicates that hedging costs might be lower for future periods compared to the present.

### Conclusion

Backwardation reflects the market's expectations of future price movements and influences various trading and risk management strategies. Understanding backwardation is crucial for market participants involved in commodities, financial derivatives, and other assets where futures contracts are used.
