- gas supply hubs (located in Wallumbilla, Queensland and Moomba, South Australia)
-  short term trading market hubs (at Brisbane, Sydney and Adelaide)

Australia is a large exporter of gas as Liquified Natural Gas, #LNG. The Eastern States supply of gas for export is primarily sourced from coal-seam gas.
