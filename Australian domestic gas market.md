# Introduction
The AEMC regulates [wholesale gas markets](https://www.aemc.gov.au/energy-system/gas/gas-markets), specifically:
- gas supply hubs (located in Wallumbilla, Queensland and Moomba, South Australia)
-  short term trading market hubs (at Brisbane, Sydney and Adelaide)
-  the declared wholesale gas market in Victoria.

# Domestic versus export gas markets
Australia is a large exporter of gas as Liquified Natural Gas, #LNG. The Eastern States supply of gas for export is primarily sourced from [coal-seam gas](https://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/energy/resources/petroleum-resources/coal-seam-gas). There is a map available showing the LNG operations around Australia and their primary gas sources [here](https://www.industry.gov.au/data-and-publications/global-resources-strategy-commodity-report-liquefied-natural-gas/the-australian-lng-industry).

Coal-seam gas is regarded as an [unconventional gas resource](https://energyinformationaustralia.com.au/conventional-vs-unconventional/) and is distinctly different to so-called coventional gas basins (e.g. the [Cooper Basin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_Basin)).  A key point is that the exporter of coal-seam gas compete with domestic gas consumers, which has increased the price of domestic gas used in electricity generation and industry [Queensland LNG deal could lead to even higher gas prices](https://www.leadingedgeenergy.com.au/blog/lng-queensland-deal/). 

This has been a direct contributor to higher #NEM wholesale electricity prices.
