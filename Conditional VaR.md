Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) is also known as expected shortfall. CVaR is the expected loss if that worst-case threshold is ever crossed. CVaR, in other words, quantifies the expected losses that occur beyond the VaR break point.

The CVaR provides insight for unexpected scenarios. The primary rationale is that at-risk organisations systematically under-estimate risk.
