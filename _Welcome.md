# Introduction
Welcome to my notebook for Energy Financial Markets. In this notebook, you will find helpful extra-curricular information that helps integrate the course concepts with real-world case studies and examples.

Since the course is about managing financial risks for energy market participants in the National Electricity Market ( #NEM) that will be our focus in this notebook. 

In all that follows, remember that [[markets are interconnected]]. Therefore, in order to understand what the [[financial risks]] are, we need to understand what are the potential risks and what causes those risks to be realised. In developing this understanding, we will also consider [[market dynamics]]. 

# Managing financial risks
Wholesale energy prices are volatile and this poses substantial financial risk for market participants. There are various financial instruments available to help manage these risks:
- [[swap]]
- [[cap]]
- [[collars]]
- [[floors]]

The effectiveness of these instruments will be determined by a range of factors such as:
- the sophistication of the financial risk managers and traders
- market liquidity
- market efficiency
- credit rating and financial standing of the market participants
- degree of market power exercised in risk markets


# Real world events
## Coal generation issues in the National Electricity Market
On 29 April 2022, the AEMO reported:
>Wholesale electricity prices in the National Electricity Market (NEM) averaged $87 per megawatt-hour (MWh) for the first quarter of 2022, up 67% from Q4 2021 and 141% on Q1 2021, driven by increased demand, `coal generator outages` and higher electricity-generating fuel costs.
>[AEMO](https://www.aemo.com.au/newsroom/media-release/electricity-prices-driven-by-outages-and-higher-generation-costs-in-volatile-march-quarter)

On 7 June 2022, the AEMO released a speech by Daniel Westerman, in which these points are highlighted:
>Today, coal accounts for 23 GW of capacity in the 60 GW National Electricity Market.  As a share of total generation in FY22, black and brown coal generators supplied over 60% of total generation in the NEM.  When the Draft ISP was released last December, 5GW of coal plant was announced to retire by 2030.  But in February, Origin announced their application for Eraring to retire in 2025. And AGL brought forward expected retirement dates for Loy Yang A and Bayswater. This now means that  8 GW of coal generation will exit the market by 2030.  
  And what we hear from asset owners is that commercial pressures on the future of these power stations are likely to continue to accelerate closure timelines.  This has all informed the modelling in our Step Change scenario, and in our soon-to-be-released 2022 Integrated System Plan, which indicates that 14 GW of coal could exit by 2030.

# Capacity investment issues
Changing electricity generation technology is raising issues in relation to the performance of Australian electricity grids. In particular, the rapid deployment of [[Variable Renewable Energy ]](VRE) systems (e.g. solar power and wind power systems). 

Core issues are:
1. The change from on-demand technology such as fuel-based electricity generators (e.g. coal-fueled steam boiler and turbines, gas-fuelled turbines) to when-available energy (e.g. solar and wind). Electricity system operators may use the terms `dispatchable` and `non-dispatchable` to make the same distinction.
2. Unbundling of services such as energy, inertia, frequency services. Fuel-based generators typically provide all three services simultaneously. By constrast, VRE systems only provide energy services. The implication being that both types of electricity generation technologies are needed, but that the combination implies a higher cost electricity system.
3. VRE systems do not emit carbon dioxide equivalent emissions, nor any other pollutants such as nitrous oxide. By contrast, fuel-based electricity generators do emit these unwanted byproducts - with the exception of hydrogen-based electricity generators.

These core issues are forcing a trade-off between  affordability and reliability. 

## Energy storage solutions
Energy storage solutions are an obvious response to VRE, but this further makes achieving the twin goals of affordability and reliability more difficult. Energy storage solutions are typically expensive relative to the incremental cost of continuing fuel-based power systems.

# Strategic interactions between competitors
The facilities-based competition paradigm established in the [[National Electricity Market]] leads to various strategic interactions between electricity producers, suppliers and consumers. 

Assessing the implications of strategic interactions is helped by applying two distinct paradigms:
1. [[Systems thinking]] and [[systems dynamics]]
2. [[game theory]]

These conceptual paradigms provide frameworks within which to analyse and synthesise the interactions between energy market participants across multiple energy markets.

# Sources of information
There are several helpful websites that provide helpful information about the Australian electricity industry, including:
- The Australian Energy Regulator, particularly the [Australian Energy Regulator “State of the Energy Market Report”](https://www.aer.gov.au/publications/state-of-the-energy-market-reports) 
- The Australian Securities Exchange [Introductory videos on Australian Electricity](https://www2.asx.com.au/markets/trade-our-derivatives-market/overview/energy-derivatives)
- The [Australian Electricity Market Operator](https://www.aemo.com.au/)
