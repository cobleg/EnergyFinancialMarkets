# Introduction
Welcome to my notebook for Energy Financial Markets. In this notebook, you will find helpful extra-curricular information that helps integrate the course concepts with real-world case studies and examples.

Since the course is about managing financial risks for energy market participants in the National Electricity Market ( #NEM) that will be our focus in this notebook. 

In all that follows, remember that markets are interconnected. Therefore, in order to understand what the financial risks are, we need to understand what is causing those

## Coal generation issues in the National Electricity Market
On 29 April 2022, the AEMO reported:
>Wholesale electricity prices in the National Electricity Market (NEM) averaged $87 per megawatt-hour (MWh) for the first quarter of 2022, up 67% from Q4 2021 and 141% on Q1 2021, driven by increased demand, `coal generator outages` and higher electricity-generating fuel costs.

On 7 June 2022, the AEMO released a speech by Daniel Westerman, in which these points are highlighted:
>Today, coal accounts for 23 GW of capacity in the 60 GW National Electricity Market.  As a share of total generation in FY22, black and brown coal generators supplied over 60% of total generation in the NEM.  When the Draft ISP was released last December, 5GW of coal plant was announced to retire by 2030.  But in February, Origin announced their application for Eraring to retire in 2025. And AGL brought forward expected retirement dates for Loy Yang A and Bayswater. This now means that  8 GW of coal generation will exit the market by 2030.  
  And what we hear from asset owners is that commercial pressures on the future of these power stations are likely to continue to accelerate closure timelines.  This has all informed the modelling in our Step Change scenario, and in our soon-to-be-released 2022 Integrated System Plan, which indicates that 14 GW of coal could exit by 2030.
