  {"id":"2008InterpretationShort","abstract":"The market rules of Western Australia’s wholesale electricity market require that a market generator must not offer prices into the market that do not reflect the market generator’s reasonable expectation of the short run marginal cost of generating the electricity when such behaviour relates to market power. As short run marginal cost is not defined in the legislation or in the market rules, there is a need for a simple and workable description of this concept.  The Economic Regulation Authority has published two papers on its web site that seek to explain short run marginal cost. The purpose of this paper is to provide a further but more simplified description of short run marginal cost to assist in its practical application in the wholesale electricity market.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,19]]},"citation-key":"2008InterpretationShort","title":"2008 Interpretation of Short Run Marginal Cost - Economic Regulation Authority Western Australia","type":"webpage","URL":"https://www.erawa.com.au/electricity/wholesale-electricity-market/regulatory-papers/2008-interpretation-of-short-run-marginal-cost"},

  {"id":"aasgardOpportunitycostpricingReservesSimple2016","abstract":"This work investigates the cost of delivering different types of balancing reserves from a simple hydropower reservoir system. In addition to delivering energy, the fast ramping characteristics of hydropower units makes them suitable for delivery of various balancing products that are needed in order to maintain system security. The price at which these products are offered is determined by the opportunity costs in the dayahead energy market. In a small case study, these opportunity costs are assessed by analyzing the changes from the optimal day-ahead production schedule for various types and volumes of reserve delivery commitments. We ﬁnd that the requirement of delivering spinning reserves may signiﬁcantly restrict the production schedule. This type of balancing service is thus found to be costly in our analysis. The special restriction of symmetric up and down regulation for primary reserves also makes this type of service more expensive as the solution space is even more restrained.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Aasgard","given":"Ellen Krohn"},{"family":"Roti","given":"Pal Henrik"}],"citation-key":"aasgardOpportunitycostpricingReservesSimple2016","container-title":"2016 13th International Conference on the European Energy Market (EEM)","DOI":"10.1109/EEM.2016.7521331","event-place":"Porto, Portugal","event-title":"2016 13th International Conference on the European Energy Market (EEM)","ISBN":"978-1-5090-1298-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",6]]},"language":"en","page":"1-5","publisher":"IEEE","publisher-place":"Porto, Portugal","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Opportunity-cost-pricing of reserves for a simple hydropower system","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7521331/"},
  {"id":"aboumahboubDecarbonizationAustraliaEnergy2020","abstract":"To achieve the Paris Agreement’s long-term temperature goal, current energy systems must be transformed. Australia represents an interesting case for energy system transformation modeling: with a power system dominated by fossil fuels and, specifically, with a heavy coal component, there is at the same time a vast potential for expansion and use of renewables. We used the multi-sectoral Australian Energy Modeling System (AUSeMOSYS) to perform an integrated analysis of implications for the electricity, transport, and selected industry sectors to the mid-century. The state-level resolution allows representation of regional discrepancies in renewable supply and the quantification of inter-regional grid extensions necessary for the physical integration of variable renewables. We investigated the impacts of different CO2 budgets and selected key factors on energy system transformation. Results indicate that coal-fired generation has to be phased out completely by 2030 and a fully renewable electricity supply achieved in the 2030s according to the cost-optimal pathway implied by the 1.5 °C Paris Agreement-compatible carbon budget. Wind and solar PV can play a dominant role in decarbonizing Australia’s energy system with continuous growth of demand due to the strong electrification of linked energy sectors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Aboumahboub","given":"Tino"},{"family":"Brecha","given":"Robert J."},{"family":"Shrestha","given":"Himalaya Bir"},{"family":"Fuentes","given":"Ursula"},{"family":"Geiges","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Hare","given":"William"},{"family":"Schaeffer","given":"Michiel"},{"family":"Welder","given":"Lara"},{"family":"Gidden","given":"Matthew J."}],"citation-key":"aboumahboubDecarbonizationAustraliaEnergy2020","container-title":"Energies","DOI":"10.3390/en13153805","ISSN":"1996-1073","issue":"15","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"15","page":"3805","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Decarbonization of Australia’s Energy System: Integrated Modeling of the Transformation of Electricity, Transportation, and Industrial Sectors","title-short":"Decarbonization of Australia’s Energy System","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/13/15/3805","volume":"13"},
  {"id":"AbstractMachine2023","abstract":"In computer science, an abstract machine is a theoretical model that allows for a detailed and precise analysis of how a computer system functions. It is similar to a mathematical function in that it receives inputs and produces outputs based on predefined rules. Abstract machines vary from literal machines in that they are expected to perform correctly and independently of hardware. Abstract machines are \"machines\" because they allow step-by-step execution of programmes; they are \"abstract\" because they ignore many aspects of actual (hardware) machines. A typical abstract machine consists of a definition in terms of input, output, and the set of allowable operations used to turn the former into the latter. They can be used for purely theoretical reasons as well as models for real-world computer systems. In the theory of computation, abstract machines are often used in thought experiments regarding computability or to analyse the complexity of algorithms. This use of abstract machines is fundamental to the field of computational complexity theory, such as finite state machines , Mealy machines, push-down automata, and Turing machines.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,5]]},"citation-key":"AbstractMachine2023","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,24]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 1135484418","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Abstract machine","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abstract_machine&oldid=1135484418"},

  {"id":"ahmadApplicationSystemDynamics2016","abstract":"Electricity has become a vital source of energy for social and economic development in modern era. Likewise, the issues of its planning and management have grown complex. To address complexity in decision making, researchers have chosen system dynamics (SD) modelling and simulation technique. A state-of-art of such studies published during the period 2000–2013 is presented in this paper. The contribution of this review lies in categorizing the literature based on the important and contemporary researched areas. These research areas include models developed for policy assessment, generation capacity expansion, financial instruments, demand side management, mixing methods, and finally micro-worlds. Review shows that policy assessment and generation capacity expansion are the two most modelled topics. Financial instruments models evaluate different mechanism to support renewable technologies whereas mixing-methods channelize descriptive approach of SD into evaluating a single objective. Demand side management and micro-worlds are the least focused categories in SD. This paper also discusses the individual models in each category highlighting their construct, outcomes and any deficiencies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Ahmad","given":"Salman"},{"family":"Mat Tahar","given":"Razman"},{"family":"Muhammad-Sukki","given":"Firdaus"},{"family":"Munir","given":"Abu Bakar"},{"family":"Abdul Rahim","given":"Ruzairi"}],"citation-key":"ahmadApplicationSystemDynamics2016","container-title":"Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews","container-title-short":"Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews","DOI":"10.1016/j.rser.2015.11.034","ISSN":"1364-0321","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"29-37","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Application of system dynamics approach in electricity sector modelling: A review","title-short":"Application of system dynamics approach in electricity sector modelling","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136403211501299X","volume":"56"},

  {"id":"albertTransitionsCareHeart2015","abstract":"In patients with heart failure (HF), use of 30-day rehospitalization as a healthcare metric and increased pressure to provide value-based care compel healthcare providers to improve efficiency and to use an integrated care approach. Transition programs are being used to achieve goals. Transition of care in the context of HF management refers to individual interventions and programs with multiple activities that are designed to improve shifts or transitions from one setting to the next, most often from hospital to home. As transitional care programs become the new normal for patients with chronic HF, it is important to understand the current state of the science of transitional care, as discussed in the available research literature. Of transitional care reports, there was much heterogeneity in research designs, methods, study aims, and program targets, or they were not well described. Often, programs used bundled interventions, making it difficult to discuss the efficiency and effectiveness of specific interventions. Thus, further HF transition care research is needed to ensure best practices related to economically and clinically effective and feasible transition interventions that can be broadly applicable. This statement provides an overview of the complexity of HF management and includes patient, hospital, and healthcare provider barriers to understanding end points that best reflect clinical benefits and to achieving optimal clinical outcomes. The statement describes transitional care interventions and outcomes and discusses implications and recommendations for research and clinical practice to enhance patient-centered outcomes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Albert","given":"Nancy M."},{"family":"Barnason","given":"Susan"},{"family":"Deswal","given":"Anita"},{"family":"Hernandez","given":"Adrian"},{"family":"Kociol","given":"Robb"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Eunyoung"},{"family":"Paul","given":"Sara"},{"family":"Ryan","given":"Catherine J."},{"family":"White-Williams","given":"Connie"}],"citation-key":"albertTransitionsCareHeart2015","container-title":"Circulation: Heart Failure","DOI":"10.1161/HHF.0000000000000006","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",3]]},"page":"384-409","publisher":"American Heart Association","source":"ahajournals.org (Atypon)","title":"Transitions of Care in Heart Failure","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/hhf.0000000000000006","volume":"8"},

  {"id":"aminApplicationBatteryEnergy2021","abstract":"In power systems, high renewable energy penetration generally results in conventional synchronous generators being displaced. Hence, the power system inertia reduces, thus causing a larger frequency deviation when an imbalance between load and generation occurs, and thus potential system instability. The problem associated with this increase in the system’s dynamic response can be addressed by various means, for example, flywheels, supercapacitors, and battery energy storage systems (BESSs). This paper investigates the application of BESSs for primary frequency control in power systems with very high penetration of renewable energy, and consequently, low levels of synchronous generation. By re-creating a major Australian power system separation event and then subsequently simulating the event under low inertia conditions but with BESSs providing frequency support, it has been demonstrated that a droop-controlled BESS can greatly improve frequency response, producing both faster reaction and smaller frequency deviation. Furthermore, it is shown via detailed investigation how factors such as available battery capacity and droop coefficient impact the system frequency response characteristics, providing guidance on how best to mitigate the impact of future synchronous generator retirements. It is intended that this analysis could be beneficial in determining the optimal BESS capacity and droop value to manage the potential frequency stability risks for a future power system with high renewable energy penetrations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Amin","given":"Md Ruhul"},{"family":"Negnevitsky","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Franklin","given":"Evan"},{"family":"Alam","given":"Kazi Saiful"},{"family":"Naderi","given":"Seyed Behzad"}],"citation-key":"aminApplicationBatteryEnergy2021","container-title":"Energies","DOI":"10.3390/en14051379","ISSN":"1996-1073","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"5","page":"1379","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Application of Battery Energy Storage Systems for Primary Frequency Control in Power Systems with High Renewable Energy Penetration","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/14/5/1379","volume":"14"},

  {"id":"andersonForwardContractsElectricity2007","abstract":"Forward contracts play a vital role in all electricity markets, and yet the details of the market for forward contracts are often opaque. In this paper we review the existing literature on forward contracts and explore the contracting process as it operates in Australia. The paper is based on interviews with participants in Australia’s National Electricity Market. The interviews were designed to understand the contracting process and the practice of risk management in the Australian energy-only pool market. This survey reveals some signiﬁcant gaps between the assumptions made in the academic literature and actual practice in the Australian market place.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Anderson","given":"Edward J."},{"family":"Hu","given":"Xinin"},{"family":"Winchester","given":"Donald"}],"citation-key":"andersonForwardContractsElectricity2007","container-title":"Energy Policy","container-title-short":"Energy Policy","DOI":"10.1016/j.enpol.2006.11.010","ISSN":"03014215","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",5]]},"language":"en","page":"3089-3103","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Forward contracts in electricity markets: The Australian experience","title-short":"Forward contracts in electricity markets","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0301421506004289","volume":"35"},

  {"id":"ansahModelingDynamicsPoverty","abstract":"Absolute poverty is all pervasive in most developing countries and particularly in Africa (Gore 2002; Sachs, Mcarthur et al. 2004) and Ghana is no exception. The poverty in developing countries is exacerbated by poor GDP growth. For instance, the growth rate per capita for sub-Saharan Africa was negative in the 1980s, i.e. about -2% per annum and about -1% per annum during the 1990s (Birdsall, Claessens et al. 2002). Most common explanation for why countries fail to achieve economic growth focuses on corrupt leadership, inability to make productive use of loans and culture that impede modern development (Korner, Maass et al. 1987; Sachs 2005). However, in recent years, the idea that poverty itself causes economic stagnation has gain attraction and engages the attention of researchers. In this paper, we developed a system dynamics model based on the system dynamics adaptation of poverty trap and debt overhang theory to establish the causal structural mechanism that explains poverty trap and determine internal poverty trends and its link with public debt accumulation. A generic system dynamics model of a developing economy whose microstructures incorporates basic mechanisms of population, production and public debt accumulation is used as a basis for analysis. We found out that the decline of per worker income in Ghana is attributed to significant reduction of investment, which consequently decreases GDP growth, coupled with high population growth. The policy analysis proposed increasing public investment or savings as the best policy to reduce poverty and public debt accumulation.","author":[{"family":"Ansah","given":"John Pastor"}],"citation-key":"ansahModelingDynamicsPoverty","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Modeling the Dynamics of Poverty Trap and Debt Accumulation","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"Anthocyanin2023","abstract":"Anthocyanins (from Ancient Greek  ἄνθος (ánthos) 'flower', and  κυάνεος/κυανοῦς (kuáneos/kuanoûs) 'dark blue'), also called anthocyans, are water-soluble vacuolar pigments that, depending on their pH, may appear red, purple, blue, or black. In 1835, the German pharmacist Ludwig Clamor Marquart gave the name Anthokyan to a chemical compound that gives flowers a blue color for the first time in his treatise \"Die Farben der Blüthen\". Food plants rich in anthocyanins include the blueberry, raspberry, black rice, and black soybean, among many others that are red, blue, purple, or black. Some of the colors of autumn leaves are derived from anthocyanins.Anthocyanins belong to a parent class of molecules called flavonoids synthesized via the phenylpropanoid pathway. They occur in all tissues of higher plants, including leaves, stems, roots, flowers, and fruits. Anthocyanins are derived from anthocyanidins by adding sugars. They are odorless and moderately astringent.\nAlthough approved as food and beverage colorant in the European Union, anthocyanins are not approved for use as a food additive because they have not been verified as safe when used as food or supplement ingredients. There is no conclusive evidence that anthocyanins have any effect on human biology or diseases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,22]]},"citation-key":"Anthocyanin2023","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,3]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 1163199309","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Anthocyanin","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anthocyanin&oldid=1163199309"},
  {"id":"anvari-moghaddamOptimalDesignOperation2017","abstract":"Energy storage systems (ESSs) can enhance the performance of energy networks in multiple ways; they can compensate the stochastic nature of renewable energies and support their large-scale integration into the grid environment. Energy storage options can also be used for economic operation of energy systems to cut down system’s operating cost. By utilizing ESSs, it is very possible to store energy in off-peak hours with lower cost and energize the grid during peak load intervals avoiding high price spikes. Application of ESSs will also enable better utilization of distributed energy sources and provide higher controllability at supply/demand side which is helpful for load leveling or peak shaving purposes. Last but not least, ESSs can provide frequency regulation services in off-grid locations where there is a strong need to meet the power balance in different operating conditions. Each of the abovementioned applications of energy storage units requires certain performance measures and constraints, which has to be well considered in design phase and embedded in control and management strategies. This chapter mainly focuses on these aspects and provides a general framework for optimal design and operation management of battery-based ESSs in energy networks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Anvari-Moghaddam","given":"Amjad"},{"family":"Dulout","given":"Jeremy"},{"family":"Alonso","given":"Corinne"},{"family":"Jammes","given":"Bruno"},{"family":"Guerrero","given":"Josep M."},{"family":"Anvari-Moghaddam","given":"Amjad"},{"family":"Dulout","given":"Jeremy"},{"family":"Alonso","given":"Corinne"},{"family":"Jammes","given":"Bruno"},{"family":"Guerrero","given":"Josep M."}],"citation-key":"anvari-moghaddamOptimalDesignOperation2017","container-title":"Advancements in Energy Storage Technologies","DOI":"10.5772/intechopen.71640","ISBN":"978-1-78923-055-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",12,20]]},"language":"en","publisher":"IntechOpen","source":"www.intechopen.com","title":"Optimal Design and Operation Management of Battery-Based Energy Storage Systems (BESS) in Microgrids","type":"chapter","URL":"https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/57594"},

  {"id":"arisPhilippinesSingaporeJourneys2020","abstract":"Malaysia is in the process of liberalising its electricity supply industry (ESI) further, with the second reform series announced in September 2018. If everything goes as planned, Malaysia would be the third country in the Association of Southeast Asia Nations (ASEAN) to have a fully liberalised ESI after the Philippines and Singapore. A number of initiatives have been in the pipeline to be executed and a lot more will be planned. At this juncture, it is important for Malaysia to look for the best practices and lessons that can be learnt from the experience of other countries that have successfully liberalised their ESIs. Being in the same region, it is believed that there is a lot that Malaysia can learn from the Philippines and Singapore. This paper therefore presents and deliberates on the chronological development of the countries’ progressive journeys in liberalising their ESIs. The aim is to discern the good practices, the challenges as well as the lessons learnt from these transformations. Analysis is being made and discussed from the following four perspectives; legislative framework, implementation phases, market components and impact on renewable energy penetration. Findings from this study would provide useful insight for Malaysia in determining the course of actions to be taken to reform its ESI. Beyond Malaysia, the findings can also serve as the reference for the other ASEAN countries in moving towards liberalising their ESIs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Aris","given":"Hazleen"},{"family":"Mohd Zawawi","given":"Iskandar Shah"},{"family":"Jørgensen","given":"Bo Nørregaard"}],"citation-key":"arisPhilippinesSingaporeJourneys2020","container-title":"Energies","DOI":"10.3390/en13143514","ISSN":"1996-1073","issue":"14","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"14","page":"3514","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"The Philippines’ and Singapore’s Journeys towards Liberalised Electricity Supply Industries—Takeaways for Malaysia","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/13/14/3514","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"atalayTheoryBatteryAgeing2020","abstract":"Forecasting the lifetime of Li-ion batteries is a critical challenge that limits the integration of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) into the automotive market. Cycle-life performance of Li-ion batteries is intrinsically linked to the fundamental understanding of ageing mechanisms. In contrast to most previous studies which utilise empirical trends (low real-time information) or rough simplifications on mathematical models to predict the lifetime of a Li-ion battery, we deployed a novel ageing formulation that includes heterogeneous dual-layer solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and lithium-plating ageing mechanisms with porosity evaluation. The proposed model is parameterized and optimized for mass transport and ageing parameters based on fresh and an aged cell and validated against our experimental results. We show that our advanced ageing mechanisms can accurately calculate experimentally observed cell voltage and capacity fade with respect to cycling number and can predict future fade for new operating scenarios based on constant-current and a dynamic power profile cycling experimental data consisting of high discharge C-rates and fast-charging periods. Our model is able to capture the linear and nonlinear (knee-point) capacity fade characteristics with a high accuracy of 98% goodness-of-fit-error and we compared our model performance with well-accepted existing model in literature.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Atalay","given":"Selcuk"},{"family":"Sheikh","given":"Muhammad"},{"family":"Mariani","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Merla","given":"Yu"},{"family":"Bower","given":"Ed"},{"family":"Widanage","given":"W.

  {"id":"baeCombiningMicrosimulationAgentbased2016","abstract":"Population dynamics illustrates the changes of the size and age composition of populations. Modeling and simulation techniques have been used to model the population dynamics, and the developed models are utilized to design and analyze public polices. One classic modeling method is microsimulation. The microsimulation describes the population dynamics at the individual level, and actions conducted by the individuals are generated by stochastic process. An emerging method is agent-based model, which rather focuses on the interactions among individuals and expects to see unexpected situations created from the interactions. Their similar but different approaches can make them to complement weak points of the opponent in population dynamics analysis. From this perspective, This paper proposes a hybrid model structure combining microsimulation and agent-based model for modeling population dynamics. In the proposed model, the microsimulation model takes a role to depict how an individual chooses its behavior based on stochastic process parameterized by real data; the agent-based model incorporates interactions among individuals considering their own states and rules. The case study introduces Korean population dynamics model developed by the proposed approach, and its simulation results show the population changes triggered by a variance of behavior and interaction factors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Bae","given":"Jang Won"},{"family":"Paik","given":"Euihyun"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Kiho"},{"family":"Singh","given":"Karandeep"},{"family":"Sajjad","given":"Mazhar"}],"citation-key":"baeCombiningMicrosimulationAgentbased2016","collection-title":"International Conference on Computational Science 2016, ICCS 2016, 6-8 June 2016, San Diego, California, USA","container-title":"Procedia Computer Science","container-title-short":"Procedia Computer Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.procs.2016.05.331","ISSN":"1877-0509","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",1,1]]},"page":"507-517","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Combining Microsimulation and Agent-based Model for Micro-level Population Dynamics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050916307359","volume":"80"},

The underlying idea is that growth, development, technological change, income inequality, spatial disparities, and resilience are the visible outcomes of hidden systemic interactions. The study of economic complexity seeks to understand the structure of these interactions and how they shape various socioeconomic processes. This emerging field relies heavily on big data and machine learning techniques. This brief introduction to economic complexity has three aims. The first is to summarize key theoretical foundations and principles of economic complexity. The second is to briefly review the tools and metrics developed in the economic complexity literature that exploit information encoded in the structure of the economy to find new empirical patterns. The final aim is to highlight the insights from economic complexity to improve prediction and political decision-making. Institutions including the World Bank, the European Commission, the World Economic Forum, the OECD, and a range of national and regional organizations have begun to embrace the principles of economic complexity and its analytical framework. We discuss policy implications of this field, in particular the usefulness of building recommendation systems for major public investment decisions in a complex world.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Balland","given":"Pierre-Alexandre"},{"family":"Broekel","given":"Tom"},{"family":"Diodato","given":"Dario"},{"family":"Giuliani","given":"Elisa"},{"family":"Hausmann","given":"Ricardo"},{"family":"O'Clery","given":"Neave"},{"family":"Rigby","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"ballandNewParadigmEconomic2022","container-title":"Research Policy","container-title-short":"Research Policy","DOI":"10.1016/j.respol.2021.104450","ISSN":"0048-7333","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,1]]},"page":"104450","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The new paradigm of economic complexity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733321002420","volume":"51"},

  {"id":"banshwarInternationalExperienceTechnical2018","abstract":"An introduction of competition in electricity markets and the substantial growth in the capacity of transactions significantly complicates the task of sustaining security and dependability of an electrical arrangement. This responsibility is dedicated to Ancillary Services (AS) that, in perspective to market liberalization, is the accountability of the System Operators (SO) to secure the requisite level of quality and safety. In the liberalized environment, AS are disaggregated from the energy generation, and can be obligated or compensated under market processes. SO seeks specific ways to define, procure and implement such services by managing active power for adjusting the frequency and reactive power for sustaining sufficient voltage profile throughout the arrangement. A comprehensive analysis of several techno-economical aspects of AS in liberalized electricity markets of a developed economy and emerging economies has been reviewed in this work. While attending the wide range of AS, the aim is to provide the promising knowledge of individual service by comparing different AS markets that exists worldwide, showing similarities and conflicts between various market models. Apart from conventional providers of AS, Renewable Energy Sources (RES) in several liberalized electricity markets seem to be a good provider of AS along with energy in order to maximize their revenue from these marketplaces. In addition to their types and definition, participation, contracting approach, selection of offers, dispatch criterion along with renewable energy participation in various electricity markets has been discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Banshwar","given":"Anuj"},{"family":"Sharma","given":"Naveen Kumar"},{"family":"Sood","given":"Yog Raj"},{"family":"Shrivastava","given":"Rajnish"}],"citation-key":"banshwarInternationalExperienceTechnical2018","container-title":"Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews","issue":"C","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en","page":"774-801","publisher":"Elsevier","source":"ideas.repec.org","title":"An international experience of technical and economic aspects of ancillary services in deregulated power industry: Lessons for emerging BRIC electricity markets","title-short":"An international experience of technical and economic aspects of ancillary services in deregulated power industry","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ideas.repec.org//a/eee/rensus/v90y2018icp774-801.html","volume":"90"},

This situation will be especially challenging for developing economies with limited capital and institutional capacity, poor infrastructure, and rapid economic growth. Using the Philippines as a case study for a developing economy, the paper identified chronic underinvestment in the supply of ancillary services that play a crucial role in balancing energy supply with demand and building grid resilience. To diagnose the cause, the paper created a novel dataset with all ancillary services revenue contracts in effect at the end of 2019 and analyzed their key terms and conditions. The paper concludes that these contracts are not conducive to financing due to short durations, low and soft buying commitments, exclusive focus on incumbent versus new entrants, hour and season constraints, and a poorly implemented remuneration methodology. The literature rarely analysis this topic from a financing perspective and at this level of detail. Revenue contracts need to switch to long-term, firm, and technology-specific cost recovery mechanisms with new entrants, to incentivize financing. Storage technologies such as batteries and hydropower should be prioritized, followed by gas turbines. These changes will result in a more secure, resilient, and affordable power system.","author":[{"family":"Barroco","given":"Jose"}],"citation-key":"barrocoDesigningFinanceableAncillary2021","container-title":"Energy Policy","container-title-short":"Energy Policy","DOI":"10.1016/j.enpol.2021.112218","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,1]]},"page":"112218","source":"ResearchGate","title":"Designing financeable ancillary services revenue contracts in developing economies: Learnings from the Philippines","title-short":"Designing financeable ancillary services revenue contracts in developing economies","type":"article-journal","volume":"152"},

  {"id":"bediDeepLearningFramework2019","abstract":"The increasing world population and availability of energy hungry smart devices are major reasons for alarmingly high electricity consumption in the current times. So far, various simulation tools, engineering and Artificial Intelligence based methods are being used to perform optimal electricity demand forecasting. While engineering methods use dynamic equations to forecast, the AI-based methods use historical data to predict future demand. However, modeling of nonlinear electricity demand patterns is still underdeveloped for robust solutions as the existing methods are useful only for handling short-term dependencies. Moreover, the existing methods are static in nature because they are purely historical data driven. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based framework to forecast electricity demand by taking care of long-term historical dependencies. Initially, the cluster analysis is performed on the electricity consumption data of all months to generate season based segmented data. Subsequently, load trend characterization is carried out to have a deeper insight of metadata falling into each of the clusters. Further, Long Short Term Memory network multi-input multi-output models are trained to forecast electricity demand based upon the season, day and interval data. In the present work, we have also incorporated the concept of moving window based active learning to improve prediction results. To demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach, it is applied to the electricity consumption data of Union Territory Chandigarh, India. Performance of the proposed approach is evaluated by comparing the prediction results with Artificial Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network and Support Vector Regression models.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Bedi","given":"Jatin"},{"family":"Toshniwal","given":"Durga"}],"citation-key":"bediDeepLearningFramework2019","container-title":"Applied Energy","issue":"C","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","page":"1312-1326","publisher":"Elsevier","source":"ideas.repec.org","title":"Deep learning framework to forecast electricity demand","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ideas.repec.org//a/eee/appene/v238y2019icp1312-1326.html","volume":"238"},

Here, I show how all cities may evolve according to a small set of basic principles that operate locally. A theoretical framework was developed to predict the average social, spatial, and infrastructural properties of cities as a set of scaling relations that apply to all urban systems. Confirmation of these predictions was observed for thousands of cities worldwide, from many urban systems at different levels of development. Measures of urban efficiency, capturing the balance between socioeconomic outputs and infrastructural costs, were shown to be independent of city size and might be a useful means to evaluate urban planning strategies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Bettencourt","given":"Luís M.

This because of that the human behavior in a real crisis or military operation is adaptive. This paper describes one approach to enable such functionality by combining Threat Analysis and Goal-Oriented Action Planning (GOAP) into an architecture where the concepts and formalism of effects and Actions plays a central role. Threat assessment is a vital part in everyday life as it enables us to prevent or evade dangerous or otherwise unwanted events. Through threat assessment we evaluate the elements of our world as we perceive and conceive it. These elements can be seen as key building blocks of the world, and depending on the situation, more or less of these keys have a direct impact on the outcome of a certain scenario taking place. An entity capable of assessing its and others action capabilities possess the power to predict how the involved entities may change their world. Through this knowledge and higher level of situation awareness, the assessing entity may choose the actions that have the most suitable effect, resulting in that entity’s desired world state. This paper covers aspects and concepts of an arbitrary planning system and presents a threat analyzer architecture built on the novel planning system Goal-Oriented Action Planning (GOAP). The realized GOAP architecture use two agents that perform action planning to reach their desired world states. One of the agents employs a modified GOAP planner used as a threat analyzer in order to determine what threat level the adversary agent constitutes. This paper does also introduce a conceptual schema of a general planning system that considers orders, doctrine and style and its representation in the Command and Control Lexical Grammar (C2LG); as well as a schema depicting an agent system using a blackboard in conjunction with the OODA-loop. 1. Introduction Threat assessment is a vital part in everyday life as it enables us to prevent or evade dangerous or otherwise unwanted events. Through threat assessment we evaluate the elements of our world as we perceive and conceive it. These elements can be seen as key building blocks of the world, and depending on the situation, more or less of these keys have a direct impact on the outcome of a certain scenario taking place. In the eyes of the beholder, or even better in the mind of the interpreter, the relevant key parts of the world are registered and in one way or the other given a certain value or reference. As our world, depending on the level of detail we wish to apply, has what seems to be an almost endless amount of world states, it would be impractical, unnecessary or even impossible to keep track of and model each and every world state. It therefore seems intuitive and wise to only model those world states deemed necessary for the scenario or context at hand.","author":[{"family":"Bjarnolf","given":"Philip"},{"family":"Gustavsson","given":"Per"},{"family":"Brax","given":"Christoffer"},{"family":"Fredin","given":"Mikael"}],"citation-key":"bjarnolfThreatAnalysisUsing2008","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",9,16]]},"source":"ResearchGate","title":"Threat Analysis Using Goal-Oriented Action Planning","type":"book"},
  {"id":"blakersReviewPumpedHydro2021","abstract":"The need for storage in electricity systems is increasing because large amounts of variable solar and wind generation capacity are being deployed. About two thirds of net global annual power capacity additions are solar and wind. Pumped hydro energy storage (PHES) comprises about 96% of global storage power capacity and 99% of global storage energy volume. Batteries occupy most of the balance of the electricity storage market including utility, home and electric vehicle batteries. Batteries are rapidly falling in price and can compete with pumped hydro for short-term storage (minutes to hours). However, pumped hydro continues to be much cheaper for large-scale energy storage (several hours to weeks). Most existing pumped hydro storage is river-based in conjunction with hydroelectric generation. Water can be pumped from a lower to an upper reservoir during times of low demand and the stored energy can be recovered at a later time. In the future, the vast storage opportunities available in closed loop off-river pumped hydro systems will be utilized. In such systems water is cycled repeatedly between two closely spaced small reservoirs located away from a river. This review covers the technology, cost, environmental impacts and opportunities for PHES. The key motivations for this review are firstly that large amounts of variable wind and solar generators are being deployed; and secondly that there are vast opportunities for low-cost pumped hydro storage that do not require interference with rivers (with the associated environmental cost).

Value in healthcare is the ratio of outcomes achieved\nover costs incurred, and can be improved by reducing cost while\nmaintaining or improving outcomes, or by improving outcomes while\nmaintaining or reducing costs.

  {"id":"bohmEstimatingFutureCosts2019","abstract":"Technological learning is a major aspect in the assessment of potential cost reductions for emerging energy technologies. Since the evaluation of experience curves requires the observation of production costs over several magnitudes of produced units, an early estimation of potential future technology implementation costs often presumes a certain degree of maturity. In this paper, we propose a calculation model for learning curves on the component or production process level, which allows to incorporate experience and knowledge on cost reduction potentials on a low level. This allows interchangeability between similar technologies, which is less feasible on a macro level. Additionally, the model is able to consider spill-over effects from concurrent technology usages for the inclusion of peripheral standard components for the assessment in an overall system view. The application of the model to the power-to-gas technology, especially water electrolysis, has shown, that the results are comparable to conventional approaches at the stack level, while providing transferability between different cell designs. In addition, the investigations made at the system level illustrate that the consideration of spill-over effects can be a relevant factor in the evaluation of cost reduction potentials, especially for technologies in an early commercial state with low numbers of cumulative productions.","author":[{"family":"Böhm","given":"Hans"},{"family":"Goers","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Zauner","given":"Andreas"}],"citation-key":"bohmEstimatingFutureCosts2019","container-title":"International Journal of Hydrogen Energy","container-title-short":"International Journal of Hydrogen Energy","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.09.230","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",11,29]]},"page":"30789-30805","source":"ResearchGate","title":"Estimating future costs of power-to-gas – a component-based approach for technological learning","type":"article-journal","volume":"44"},

These distort comparisons of inflation from different periods, which have become more prevalent as inflation has risen to 40-year highs. To better contextualize the current run-up in inflation, this paper constructs new historical series for CPI headline and core inflation that are more consistent with current practices and expenditure shares for the post-war period. Using these series, we find that current inflation levels are much closer to past inflation peaks than the official series would suggest. In particular, the rate of core CPI disinflation caused by Volcker-era policies is significantly lower when measured using today’s treatment of housing: only 5 percentage points of decline instead of 11 percentage points in the official CPI statistics. To return to 2 percent core CPI inflation today will thus require nearly the same amount of disinflation as achieved under Chairman Volcker.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Bolhuis","given":"Marijn A."},{"family":"Cramer","given":"Judd N.

  {"id":"bolingerUtilityScaleSolarData2020","abstract":"Berkeley Lab’s 2020 update of utility-scale solar data and trends provides an overview of key trends in the U.S. market, with a focus on 2019. Highlights of this year’s update include: More than 4.5 GWAC of utility-scale solar (i.e., ground-mounted solar projects larger than 5 MWAC) achieved commercial operations in 2019, bringing cumulative capacity to 29 GWAC. Projects are spread across all 10 regions that we track, though more heavily concentrated in the sunniest regions. The median installed cost of projects that came online in 2019 fell to $\\$$1.4/WAC ($\\$$1.2/WDC), down 20% from 2018 and down by more than 70% from 2010. 77% of projects and 88% of capacity added in 2019 used single-axis tracking. Average capacity factors range from 17% in the least-sunny regions to 30% where it is sunniest. Single-axis tracking adds roughly five percentage points to capacity factor in the regions with the strongest solar resource. Nationwide average levelized power purchase agreement (PPA) prices fell to $\\$$24/MWh in 2019, down 17% from 2018 and more than 80% since 2010. Thirty-nine projects (totaling 4.2 GWAC) in our PPA price sample include battery storage (totaling 2.3 GWAC and 9.5 GWh). In the “lower 48” states, a number of these recent PV+battery PPAs have been inked in the mid-$\\$$20/MWh range (levelized in 2019 dollars).Not including the 30% investment tax credit (ITC), the median levelized cost of energy (LCOE) from utility-scale PV has declined by 85% since 2010, to $\\$$40/MWh in 2019. When the 30% ITC is included within the LCOE calculation, the median LCOE closely tracks the median PPA price over time. In higher-penetration markets like CAISO, the value of solar has been declining, but falling PPA prices have largely kept pace, preserving solar's net value.

  {"id":"borettiTechnoeconomicPerformancesFuture2021","abstract":"The prediction of the techno-economic performances of future concentrated solar power (CSP) solar tower (ST) with thermal energy storage (TES) plants is challenging. Nevertheless, this information is fundamental to energy policymakers. This work aims to fill the knowledge gap regarding estimations of costs, amount, and quality of electricity produced by these plants over their lifetime. Every estimate should be based on real-world data of actual costs incurred to build and maintain constructed plants, and their actual electricity production, sampled with high frequency, to be reliable. Here we discuss as the available information is insufficient. There has been so far very limited transparency on the real cost and performance of CSP plants built and operated worldwide, and in the very few cases where data has been made public, for example, Crescent Dunes in the United States, costs have been much higher than expected, while annual average capacity factors have been much less. Important statistical parameters such as the standard deviation of the capacity factor with high-frequency sampling have never been provided. We conclude as the techno-economic performances of these plants are therefore unpredictable with accuracy until a significant number of plants will be built and operated, their costs and operating parameters will be shared, and their delivered techno-economic performances will be compared to the modeled values, finally permitting validation of the techno-economic analysis tools.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Boretti","given":"Alberto"},{"family":"Castelletto","given":"Stefania"}],"citation-key":"borettiTechnoeconomicPerformancesFuture2021","container-title":"Humanities and Social Sciences Communications","container-title-short":"Humanit Soc Sci Commun","DOI":"10.1057/s41599-021-01005-3","ISSN":"2662-9992","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,15]]},"language":"en","license":"2021 The Author(s)","number":"1","page":"1-10","publisher":"Palgrave","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Techno-economic performances of future concentrating solar power plants in Australia","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-021-01005-3","volume":"8"},

  {"id":"boroumandHedgingStrategiesEnergy2015","abstract":"As market intermediaries, electricity retailers buy electricity from the wholesale market or self-generate for re(sale) on the retail market. Electricity retailers are uncertain about how much electricity their residential customers will use at any time of the day until they actually turn switches on. While demand uncertainty is a common feature of all commodity markets, retailers generally rely on storage to manage demand uncertainty. On electricity markets, retailers are exposed to joint quantity and price risk on an hourly basis given the physical singularity of electricity as a commodity. In the literature on electricity markets, few articles deal on intra-day hedging portfolios to manage joint price and quantity risk whereas electricity markets are hourly markets. The contributions of the article are twofold. First, we define through a VaR and CVaR model optimal portfolios for specific hours (3am, 6am,. . . ,12pm) based on electricity market data from 2001 to 2011 for the French market. We prove that the optimal hedging strategy differs depending on the cluster hour. Secondly, we demonstrate the significantly superior efficiency of intra-day hedging portfolios over daily (therefore weekly and yearly) portfolios. Over a decade (2001–2011), our results clearly show that the losses of an optimal daily portfolio are at least nine times higher than the losses of optimal intra-day portfolios.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Boroumand","given":"Raphaël Homayoun"},{"family":"Goutte","given":"Stéphane"},{"family":"Porcher","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Porcher","given":"Thomas"}],"citation-key":"boroumandHedgingStrategiesEnergy2015","container-title":"Energy Economics","container-title-short":"Energy Economics","DOI":"10.1016/j.eneco.2015.06.021","ISSN":"0140-9883","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"503-509","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Hedging strategies in energy markets: The case of electricity retailers","title-short":"Hedging strategies in energy markets","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988315002170","volume":"51"},
  {"id":"bostonCharacterisationMitigationRenewable2022","abstract":"In a decarbonising world, the electricity generation mix in Australia’s National Electricity Market (NEM) is likely to be heavily dependent on wind and solar. Designing an electricity system dominated by variable renewable energy generation requires careful examination of periods of low renewable output to ensure storage or other back up generation is sufficient to avoid loss of load. This study uses 15 years of climate and electricity demand data to examine the frequency and nature of the occurrence of low renewable periods. It examines strategies for their mitigation so that unserved energy standards are not breached. We have found that the winter period, May to August, is the time where the NEM is at greatest risk of loss of load. This winter period is when the demand in southern Australian states is higher, solar generation is lower and a series of low wind periods can drain storage. It has been demonstrated that any proposed generation mix reliant on renewable energy generation should be stress tested across a low wind winter, like the complex winter of 2010, not just a single isolated low wind period. Storage was found to be ideal to provide energy for a few hours overnight, but firm dispatchable thermal generation is likely to be a lower cost option than long term storage for extended low wind periods. Diversifying generation with the addition of offshore wind may reduce the need for storage, although the need for floating wind turbines may make this alternative too expensive to add any value in the Australian context.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Boston","given":"Andy"},{"family":"Bongers","given":"Geoffrey D."},{"family":"Bongers","given":"Nathan"}],"citation-key":"bostonCharacterisationMitigationRenewable2022","container-title":"Environmental Research Communications","container-title-short":"Environ.

This approach uses an agent-based model to encompass the detailed behavior of individuals and their immediate network of relationships, as well as an influence-based system dynamics model to show how society-level influences function interactively and with respect to individual agents. The exploration of technology adoption grounds the model in a realistic environment and allows the incorporation of theoretical models from multiple relevant domains. The integrated model demonstrates how representing behavior at multiple levels of abstraction is a natural approach that allows for a greater understanding of the relationship of influences across sociological scales.","author":[{"family":"Briscoe","given":"Erica"},{"family":"Trewhitt","given":"Ethan"},{"family":"Hutto","given":"C.J."}],"citation-key":"briscoeClosingMicroMacroDivide2023","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,13]]},"source":"ResearchGate","title":"Closing the Micro-Macro Divide in Modeling Technology Adoption","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"burgersWorldwideDevelopmentPotential2011","abstract":"In this study, we summarize data on the location and scale of proven and probable sour gas resources and compare with size and location of oil fields. This provides an indication of the location and scale of opportunities to gain further experience in the application of CCS. This by using captured carbon dioxide (CO2) from sour gas resources, which are presently undeveloped or underdeveloped, for carbon dioxide enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR). Currently there are globally many undeveloped or underdeveloped sour gas accumulations containing a significant fraction of CO2. The high CO2 content between 15% and 80%, as well as in some cases the addition of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), severely limits the economic and environmental viability of sour gas resources. Globally a total resource of around 4 trillion m3 of net hydrocarbon gas and 15000 MT of associated CO2 has been identified. This was done by summing individual undeveloped and underdeveloped fields with ultimate recoverable proven and probable resources larger than 14 billion m3 each of net hydrocarbon gas and CO2 content between 15% and 80%. Development of these fields could be enabled by the availability of a cost effective gas separation method such as the Controlled Freeze ZoneTM (CFZ) technology, and of viable CO2 enhanced oil recovery opportunities (CO2-EOR) to reduce the cost of CO2 capture, transportation and storage. Sour gas resources have been mapped globally using the IHS fields and reservoirs database from 2009. The largest concentrations of sour gas are located in SE Asia & NW Australia, Central USA, Middle East and North Africa. In the USA, Middle East and North Africa, which are oil rich, there is significant potential for CO2-EOR opportunities. The relative absence of significant oil accumulations in SE Asia & NW Australia will in many cases require the storage of CO2 in saline aquifers, as is planned for the Gorgon field in Australia.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Burgers","given":"W.F.J."},{"family":"Northrop","given":"P.S."},{"family":"Kheshgi","given":"H.S."},{"family":"Valencia","given":"J.A."}],"citation-key":"burgersWorldwideDevelopmentPotential2011","container-title":"Energy Procedia","container-title-short":"Energy Procedia","DOI":"10.1016/j.egypro.2011.02.104","ISSN":"18766102","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"language":"en","page":"2178-2184","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Worldwide development potential for sour gas","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1876610211003018","volume":"4"},

  {"id":"camunasgarcia-miguelImpactRiskMeasures2023","abstract":"The deployment of energy storage systems to the grid is expected to mitigate the effects of load imbalances caused by the variability of renewable energy sources. To motivate the investments in grid- connected energy storage systems, these projects must be economically feasible. This can be approached by optimizing the energy arbitrage scheduling process. A common approach is to consider this process as a stochastic optimization problem. Recent works tend to implement risk measures such as Conditional Variance (CVaR) in the optimization process. In this work, the use of risk measures in the bidding strategy formulation is evaluated with a detailed simulation of a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) performing arbitrage in the Iberian electricity market using historical data. A degradation model based on the Rainflow counting method is implemented to avoid neglecting battery ageing with usage.

  {"id":"CapacityFactor2022","abstract":"The net capacity factor is the unitless ratio of actual electrical energy output over a given period of time to the theoretical maximum electrical energy output over that period. The theoretical maximum energy output of a given installation is defined as that due to its continuous operation at full nameplate capacity over the relevant period. The capacity factor can be calculated for any electricity producing installation, such as a fuel consuming power plant or one using renewable energy, such as wind or the sun. The average capacity factor can also be defined for any class of such installations, and can be used to compare different types of electricity production.\nThe actual energy output during that period and the capacity factor vary greatly depending on a range of factors. The capacity factor can never exceed the availability factor, or uptime during the period. Uptime can be reduced due to, for example, reliability issues and maintenance, scheduled or unscheduled. Other factors include the design of the installation, its location, the type of electricity production and with it either the fuel being used or, for renewable energy, the local weather conditions. Additionally, the capacity factor can be subject to regulatory constraints and market forces, potentially affecting both its fuel purchase and its electricity sale.\nThe capacity factor is often computed over a timescale of a year, averaging out most temporal fluctuations. However, it can also be computed for a month to gain insight into seasonal fluctuations. Alternatively, it can be computed over the lifetime of the power source, both while operational and after decommissioning. A capacity factor can also be expressed and converted to full load hours.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,18]]},"citation-key":"CapacityFactor2022","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,29]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 1118828767","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Capacity factor","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Capacity_factor&oldid=1118828767"},

  {"id":"CapitalGainsTax2023","abstract":"A capital gains tax (CGT) is the tax on profits realized on the sale of a non-inventory asset. The most common capital gains are realized from the sale of stocks, bonds, precious metals, real estate, and property.\nNot all countries impose a capital gains tax and most have different rates of taxation for individuals versus corporations. Countries that do not impose a capital gains tax include Bahrain, Barbados, Belize, Cayman Islands, Isle of Man, Jamaica, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, Singapore, and others. In some countries, such as New Zealand and Singapore, professional traders and those who trade frequently are taxed on such profits as a business income. In Sweden, the Investment Savings Account (ISK – Investeringssparkonto) was introduced in 2012 in response to a decision by Parliament to stimulate saving in funds and equities. There is no tax on capital gains in ISKs; instead, the saver pays an annual standard low rate of tax. Fund savers nowadays mainly choose to save in funds via investment savings accounts.\nCapital gains tax can be payable on valuable items or assets sold at a profit. Antiques, shares, precious metals and second homes could be all subject to the tax if you make enough money from them. How much tax is payable can differ. The lower boundary of profit that is big enough to have a tax imposed on it is set by the government. If the profit is lower than this limit it is tax-free. The profit is in most cases the difference between the amount (or value) an asset is sold and the amount it was bought for.\nThe tax rate of the capital gains tax depends on how much profit you gained and also on how much money you make annually. For example, in the UK the CGT is currently (tax year 2021–22) 10% of the profit if your income is under £50,000, then it is 20% if your income exceeds this limit. There is an additional tax that adds 8% to the existing tax rate if the profit comes from residential property. If any property is sold with loss, it is possible to offset it against annual gains. The CGT allowance for one tax year in the UK is currently £12,300 for an individual and double (£24,600) if you are a married couple or in a civil partnership. For equities, an example of a popular and liquid asset, national and state legislation often has a large array of fiscal obligations that must be respected regarding capital gains. Taxes are charged by the state over the transactions, dividends and capital gains on the stock market. However, these fiscal obligations may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,13]]},"citation-key":"CapitalGainsTax2023","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,3]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 1131275905","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Capital gains tax","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Capital_gains_tax&oldid=1131275905#Philippines"},

  {"id":"carnovaleModelingExperimentalStudy2020","abstract":"Lithium-ion batteries are extensively used in electric vehicles, however, their significant degradation over discharge and charge cycles results in severe capacity fade, limiting driving ranges of electric vehicles over time and useful lifetime of batteries. In this study, capacity fade for lithium-ion battery has been investigated through modeling and experiment. A predictive model is developed based on first principles incorporating degradation mechanisms. The mechanisms of degradation considered include solid-electrolyte interface (SEI) growth and active material loss at both negative and positive electrodes. Battery performance including capacity is measured experimentally under discharge and charge cycling with battery operation temperature controlled. It is shown that battery capacity is reduced over battery discharge/charge cycling at a given battery operation temperature, and the model predicted battery performance, including capacity fade, agrees well with the experimental results. As the number of discharge/charge cycles are increased, battery capacity is reduced significantly; battery capacity fade is increased substantially when battery operation temperature is increased, indicating significantly accelerated aging of the battery at elevated operation temperatures and hence the importance of battery thermal management in the control of battery operation temperature for practical applications such as electric vehicles. Battery capacity fade is mainly caused by SEI film growth at the negative electrode, which is the largest contributing factor to the capacity fade, and the active material isolation at the negative electrode, which is the second largest influencing aging factor.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Carnovale","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xianguo"}],"citation-key":"carnovaleModelingExperimentalStudy2020","container-title":"Energy and AI","container-title-short":"Energy and AI","DOI":"10.1016/j.egyai.2020.100032","ISSN":"2666-5468","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"100032","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"A modeling and experimental study of capacity fade for lithium-ion batteries","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266654682030032X","volume":"2"},

It uses requirement trees, value functions and the analytic hierarchy process. The model consists of 27 parameters and makes it possible to obtain a sustainability index for each conventional or renewable energy plant, throughout its life-cycle. Here the aim is to make society aware of the sustainability level for each type of power system. As a result, decision making can be done with greater objectivity in both the public and private sectors. The model can be useful for engineers, researchers and, in general, decision makers in the energy policy field. With the exception of biomass fuels, the results obtained reinforce the idea that renewable energies make a greater contribution to sustainable development than their conventional counterparts. Renewable energies have a sustainability index that varies between 0.39 and 0.80; 0 and 1 being the lowest and highest contribution to sustainability, respectively. On the other hand, conventional power plants obtained results that fall between 0.29 and 0.57.

  {"id":"castroDataTechnoeconomicFinancial2022","abstract":"This data article contains the location, energy consumption, renewable energy potential, techno-economics, and profitability of hybrid renewable energy systems (HRES) in 634 Philippine off-grid islands. The HRES under consideration consists of solar photovoltaics, wind turbines, lithium-ion batteries, and diesel generators. The islands were identified from Google Maps™, Bing Maps™, and the study of Meschede and Ocon et al. (2019). The peak loads of these islands were acquired from National Power Corporation – Small Power Utilities Group (NPC-SPUG), if available, or estimated from the island population otherwise. Hourly-resolution load profiles were synthesized using the normalized profiles reported by Bertheau and Blechinger (2018). Existing diesel generators in the islands were compiled from reports by NPC-SPUG, while monthly average global horizontal irradiance and wind speeds were taken from the Phil-LIDAR 2 database. Islands that are electrically interconnected were lumped into one microgrid, so the 634 islands were grouped into 616 microgrids. The HRES were optimized using Island System LCOEmin Algorithm (ISLA), our in-house energy systems modeling tool, which sized the energy components to minimize the net present cost. The component sizes and corresponding techno-economic metrics of the optimized HRES in each microgrid are included in the dataset. In addition, the net present value, internal rate of return, payback period, and subsidy requirements of the microgrid are reported at five different electricity rates. This data is valuable for researchers, policymakers, and stakeholders who are working to provide sustainable energy access to off-grid communities.

  {"id":"chenDynamicOptimizationSubcritical2018","abstract":"The increasing variability in power plant load in response to a wildly uncertain electricity market and the need to to mitigate CO2 emissions, lead power plant operators to explore advanced options for efficiency optimization. Model-based, system-scale dynamic simulation and optimization are useful tools in this effort and are the subjects of the work presented here. In prior work, a dynamic model validated against steady-state data from a 605 MW subcritical power plant was presented. This power plant model was used as a test-bed for dynamic simulations, in which the coal load was regulated to satisfy a varying power demand. Plant-level control regulated the plant load to match an anticipated trajectory of the power demand. The efficiency of the power plant’s operation at varying loads was optimized through a supervisory control architecture that performs set point optimization on the regulatory controllers. Dynamic optimization problems were formulated to search for optimal time-varying input trajectories that satisfy operability and safety constraints during the transition between plant states. An improvement in time-averaged efficiency of up to 1.8% points was shown to be feasible with corresponding savings in coal consumption of 184.8 tons/day and a carbon footprint decrease of 0.035 kg/kWh.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Chen"},{"family":"Bollas","given":"George M."}],"citation-key":"chenDynamicOptimizationSubcritical2018","container-title":"Processes","DOI":"10.3390/pr6080114","ISSN":"2227-9717","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",8]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"8","page":"114","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Dynamic Optimization of a Subcritical Steam Power Plant Under Time-Varying Power Load","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/6/8/114","volume":"6"},

  {"id":"chenGraphBasedLabelPropagation2021","abstract":"Speaker identification in the household scenario (e.g., for smart speakers) is typically based on only a few enrollment utterances but a much larger set of unlabeled data, suggesting semisupervised learning to improve speaker profiles. We propose a graph-based semi-supervised learning approach for speaker identification in the household scenario, to leverage the unlabeled speech samples. In contrast to most of the works in speaker recognition that focus on speaker-discriminative embeddings, this work focuses on speaker label inference (scoring). Given a pre-trained embedding extractor, graphbased learning allows us to integrate information about both labeled and unlabeled utterances. Considering each utterance as a graph node, we represent pairwise utterance similarity scores as edge weights. Graphs are constructed per household, and speaker identities are propagated to unlabeled nodes to optimize a global consistency criterion. We show in experiments on the VoxCeleb dataset that this approach makes effective use of unlabeled data and improves speaker identification accuracy compared to two state-of-the-art scoring methods as well as their semi-supervised variants based on pseudo-labels.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Long"},{"family":"Ravichandran","given":"Venkatesh"},{"family":"Stolcke","given":"Andreas"}],"citation-key":"chenGraphBasedLabelPropagation2021","container-title":"Interspeech 2021","DOI":"10.21437/Interspeech.2021-1209","event-title":"Interspeech 2021","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,30]]},"language":"en","page":"4588-4592","publisher":"ISCA","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Graph-Based Label Propagation for Semi-Supervised Speaker Identification","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/interspeech_2021/chen21v_interspeech.html"},

Therefore, it is necessary to manage the VER penetration limit in power systems for stable operation and to increase the operability to the desired level. This study proposes a method to evaluate and quantify the effect of increasing the penetration limit of VER by controlling a battery energy storage system (BESS). The BESS can provide a fast response, but frequency response performance varies depending on the operating conditions. In the proposed quantification method, various control methods of a BESS, operating conditions of the power system, and penetration conditions of additional VER were analyzed, and the effect of the BESS on increasing the penetration limit of VER was evaluated. This evaluation and analysis enabled the selection of the BESS operating conditions to achieve the target VER capacity in the power system. The proposed quantification method was analyzed through simulations based on the Korean power system model. Therefore, it can contribute to estimating the required performance of the BESS for each system operating condition required to achieve the VER target.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Choi","given":"Woo Yeong"},{"family":"Kook","given":"Kyung Soo"},{"family":"Yoo","given":"Hyeong-Jun"}],"citation-key":"choiEffectQuantificationBESS2022","container-title":"Energies","DOI":"10.3390/en15249380","ISSN":"1996-1073","issue":"24","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"24","page":"9380","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Effect Quantification of BESS Providing Frequency Response on Penetration Limit of VER in Power Systems","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/24/9380","volume":"15"},

Estimates of the future number of melanoma cases are important for strategic planning of the care pathway. The aim of this study was to use system dynamics modelling to evaluate the long-term effects of changes in incidence, population growth and preventive interventions. Historical data on invasive melanoma cases in Western Sweden from 1990 to 2006 were obtained. Using computer simulation software, a model estimating the accumulated number of melanoma cases for 2014 to 2023 was developed. Five future scenarios were designed: stable incidence, business-as-usual, 25% reduced patient's delay, 50% reduced doctor's delay, and a combination of the last two, called improved overall secondary prevention. After 10 years, improved overall secondary prevention would have resulted in a 42% decrease in melanomas > 4 mm and a 10% increase in melanomas ≤ 1 mm, compared with business-as-usual. System dynamics is a valuable tool, which can help policymakers choose the preventive interventions with the greatest impact.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Claeson","given":"Magdalena"},{"family":"Hallberg","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Holmström","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Wennberg","given":"Ann-Marie"},{"family":"Gonzalez","given":"Helena"},{"family":"Paoli","given":"John"}],"citation-key":"claesonModellingFutureSystem2016","container-title":"Acta Dermato-Venereologica","DOI":"10.2340/00015555-2222","ISSN":"1651-2057","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright (c) 2015 Magdalena Claeson, Stefan Hallberg, Paul Holmström, Ann-Marie Wennberg, Helena Gonzalez, John Paoli","number":"2","page":"181-185","source":"medicaljournalssweden.se","title":"Modelling the Future: System Dynamics in the Cutaneous Malignant Melanoma Care Pathway","title-short":"Modelling the Future","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://medicaljournalssweden.se/actadv/article/view/5951","volume":"96"},

The findings show our usage is sparse and our vocabulary limited: only seven terms account for 88% of our usage, and even when we use those terms, we often only mention them once or twice in a paper, if at all. This article proposes expanding our vocabulary with 20 terms across five categories: hierarchy, bottom-up, top-down, transitional, and experimental.

The economic recovery in China remains subdued and industrial activity is muted, particularly in manufacturing and construction, weighing on demand for commodities. At the same time, the domestic inventory of coal in China has reached historical high levels due to low demand and significant imports. During the first four months of 2023, China experienced a modest increase of only 4.8% in raw coal output, while imports surged by a substantial 88.8%. Outside China, falling natural gas prices have contributed to Europe's shift away from coal consumption.

  {"id":"CorporateProjectFinance2014","abstract":"A clear and comprehensive guide to financial modeling and valuation with extensive case studies and practice exercises Corporate and Project Finance Modeling takes a clear, coherent approach to a complex and technical topic. Written by a globally-recognized financial and economic consultant, this book provides a thorough explanation of financial modeling and analysis while describing the practical application of newly-developed techniques. Theoretical discussion, case studies and step-by-step guides allow readers to master many difficult modeling problems and also explain how to build highly structured models from the ground up. The companion website includes downloadable examples, templates, and hundreds of exercises that allow readers to immediately apply the complex ideas discussed. Financial valuation is an in-depth process, involving both objective and subjective parameters. Precise modeling is critical, and thorough, accurate analysis is what bridges the gap from model to value. This book allows readers to gain a true mastery of the principles underlying financial modeling and valuation by helping them to: Develop flexible and accurate valuation analysis incorporating cash flow waterfalls, depreciation and retirements, updates for new historic periods, and dynamic presentation of scenario and sensitivity analysis; Build customized spreadsheet functions that solve circular logic arising in project and corporate valuation without cumbersome copy and paste macros; Derive accurate measures of normalized cash flow and implied valuation multiples that account for asset life, changing growth, taxes, varying returns and cost of capital; Incorporate stochastic analysis with alternative time series equations and Monte Carlo simulation without add-ins; Understand valuation effects of debt sizing, sculpting, project funding, re-financing, holding periods and credit enhancements. Corporate and Project Finance Modeling provides comprehensive guidance and extensive explanation, making it essential reading for anyone in the field.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,18]]},"citation-key":"CorporateProjectFinance2014","edition":"1","ISBN":"978-1-118-85445-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",11]]},"language":"en-us","number-of-pages":"624","publisher":"Wiley","title":"Corporate and Project Finance Modeling: Theory and Practice | Wiley","title-short":"Corporate and Project Finance Modeling","type":"book","URL":"https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Corporate+and+Project+Finance+Modeling%3A+Theory+and+Practice-p-9781118854365"},

At the same time, wind and solar PV have unique characteristics relative to the historically dominant dispatchable technologies like coal, gas, and nuclear power plants that have required and will continue to require changes in power system planning and operations. This chapter discusses planning and operational challenges of integrating wind and solar PV into bulk power systems. We first present the key characteristics of wind and solar PV that differentiate it from conventional technologies, such as variable and uncertain electricity generation, asynchronous interconnection to the power system, and near-zero marginal costs. We then link these characteristics to power system planning and operational challenges at low through high wind and solar penetrations. Finally, we discuss near- and long-term solutions to those challenges, such as diversifying the generation mix and wind and solar fleets, improving system flexibility, diversifying ancillary service products, and integrating generation and transmission planning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Craig","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Brancucci","given":"Carlo"}],"citation-key":"craigChapterImpactVariable2021","DOI":"10.1016/B978-0-12-814712-2.00009-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,7]]},"language":"English","number":"NREL/CH-5D00-73666","publisher":"London, United Kingdom: Academic Press","source":"www.osti.gov","title":"Chapter 9: Impact of Variable Renewable Energy Sources on Bulk Power System Planning and Operations","title-short":"Chapter 9","type":"report","URL":"https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1810279"},

We categorize SD contributions into three groups—disease-related modeling, organizational modeling, and regional health modeling—and explore major trends and approaches. We then focus on disease-related modeling and discuss (1) common structures underlying models of infectious and noninfectious diseases, (2) major findings and modeling insights, and (3) avenues for future modeling efforts. While application areas cover a wide range of contexts, a considerable level of quality variation is observable, particularly in regards to model documentation, use of data, and model validation. While these shortcomings are not specific to SD modeling—and other schools of modeling often suffer from similar problems—we invite the community to address the issues both as authors and reviewers. Our study provides a reference document for several exemplary SD models, which is especially useful for early career modelers. © 2020 System Dynamics Society","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Darabi","given":"Negar"},{"family":"Hosseinichimeh","given":"Niyousha"}],"citation-key":"darabiSystemDynamicsModeling2020","container-title":"System Dynamics Review","DOI":"10.1002/sdr.1646","ISSN":"1099-1727","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2020 System Dynamics Society","page":"29-73","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"System dynamics modeling in health and medicine: a systematic literature review","title-short":"System dynamics modeling in health and medicine","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sdr.1646","volume":"36"},

  {"id":"deaneTechnoeconomicReviewExisting2010","abstract":"There has been a renewed commercial and technical interest in pumped hydro energy storage (PHES) recently with the advent of increased variable renewable energy generation and the development of liberalized electricity markets. During the next 8 years over 7Â GW of PHES capacity will be added to the European network while projects are also planned in the USA and Japan. This paper provides a review of existing and proposed PHES plant and discusses the technical and economic drivers for these developments. Current trends for new PHES development generally show that developers operating in liberalized markets are tending to repower, enhance projects or build 'pump-back' PHES rather than traditional 'pure pumped storage'. Capital costs per kW for proposed PHES in the review region range between [euro]470/kW and [euro]2170/kW, however these costs are highly site and project specific. An emergence has also been observed in recent PHES developments of the use of variable speed technology. This technology, while incurring slightly higher capital costs, offers a greater range of operational flexibility and efficiency over conventional PHES. This paper has primarily been prompted by a lack of detailed information on PHES facilities worldwide and reviews current developments in the context of market and generation mix changes. The most recent large scale review of PHES faculties was undertaken by the American Society of Civil Engineers Hydro Power Task Committee on Pumped Storage in 1996. In the absence of data in the literature on new PHES plant development, this review draws primarily on publicly available information from utilities, government bodies and electricity regulators. In the same context this study is limited to a review region of the European Union, Japan and the United States as information on developments outside these areas is difficult to procure. This paper also gives a review of locations and proposed timelines for new PHES development and provides a thorough up-to-date overview of the development trends of this technology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Deane","given":"J.

  {"id":"debeerInfluencesEnergyThroughput2016","abstract":"The growing integration of solar photovoltaic systems into the national power grid has the potential to increase grid instability. Instability is caused by the fluctuating irra-diance on the solar panels owing to weather conditions such as passing cloud cover. These fluctuations can be mitigated by energy storage systems such as batteries. Selecting the correct battery technology is a challenge since affordability and performance are important deciding factors. A method is required to determine which battery technology will be the superior option while also satisfying all the design criteria, in other words, a method which estimates the life span of different battery technologies based on operational conditions determined by the user (in this case, the regional weather). A battery state-of-health model and a fluctuation mit-igation model are identified and selected. The models are tested separately and then combined to create a final model. The results produced indicate that the fluctuation mitigation utilises the batteries in such a way that battery life is optimised and that the battery capacity and depth-of-discharge will determine the mitigation performance. It is found that the two models work well together. The model methods can be questioned and have yet to be tested practically.","author":[{"family":"De Beer","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Rix","given":"Arnold"}],"citation-key":"debeerInfluencesEnergyThroughput2016","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",10,31]]},"language":"en","source":"ResearchGate","title":"Influences of Energy Throughput on the Life of Various Battery Technologies","type":"book","URL":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/313249361_Influences_of_Energy_Throughput_on_the_Life_of_Various_Battery_Technologies"},

  {"id":"devanandOntoPowSysPowerSystem2020","abstract":"Knowledge management in multi-domain, heterogeneous industrial networks like an Eco-Industrial Park (EIP) is a challenging task. In this paper, an ontology-based management system has been proposed for addressing this challenge. It focuses on the power systems domain and provides a framework for integrating this knowledge with the other domains of an EIP. The proposed ontology, OntoPowSys is expressed using a Description Logics (DL) syntax and the OWL2 language was used to make it alive. It is then used as a part of the Knowledge Management System (KMS) in a virtual EIP called the J-Park Simulator (JPS). The advantages of the proposed approach are demonstrated by conducting two case studies on the JPS. The first case study illustrates the application of optimal power flow (OPF) in the electrical network of the JPS. The second case study plays an important role in understanding the cross-domain interactions between the chemical and electrical engineering domains in a bio-diesel plant of the JPS. These case studies are available as web services on the JPS website. The results showcase the advantages of using ontologies in the development of decision support tools. These tools are capable of taking into account contextual information on top of data during their decision-making processes. They are also able to exchange knowledge across different domains without the need for a communication interface.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Devanand","given":"Aravind"},{"family":"Karmakar","given":"Gourab"},{"family":"Krdzavac","given":"Nenad"},{"family":"Rigo-Mariani","given":"Rémy"},{"family":"Foo Eddy","given":"Y.

Sub-system efficiencies are further dependent on numerous parameters which are interdependent. Therefore, methodology developed at system level is extended to sub-system level. Performance parameter digraph is developed at sub-system level by intriguing inheritance and interdependencies of parameters. Digraph is converted into matrix form and permanent function is developed.

This project received funding under the Australian Renewable Energy Agency’s (ARENA) Regional Australia’s Renewables (RAR) initiative for the purposes of seeking to improve the competitiveness of renewable energy systems on the North-West Interconnected System (NWIS), and generating and sharing knowledge that will assist network operators and decision makers to better understand the economic value and technical viability of connecting distributed renewable energy generation on remote, stretched grids. Among the results shown are the observed reduction in ramp rates, the lost yield due to both curtailment and BESS losses, and the degree to which the BESS’s available power and energy capacity have been utilised.

  {"id":"dingOperationalReliabilityEvaluation2014","abstract":"In the last two decades, the wind power generation has been rapidly and widely developed in many regions and countries for tackling the problems of environmental pollution and sustainability of energy supply. However, the high share of intermittent and fluctuating wind power production has also increased the burden of system operator for securing power system reliability during the operational phase. Moreover, the power system restructuring and deregulation have not only introduced the competition for reducing cost but also changed the strategy of reliability evaluation and management of power systems. The conventional long-term reliability evaluation techniques have been well developed, which have been more focused on planning and expansion rather than operation of power systems. This paper proposes a new technique for evaluating operational reliabilities of restructured power systems with high wind power penetration. The proposed technique is based on the combination of the reliability network equivalent and time-sequential simulation approaches. The operational reliability network equivalents are developed to represent reliability models of wind farms, conventional generation and reserve provides, fast reserve providers and transmission network in restructured power systems. A contingency management schema for real time operation considering its coupling with the day-ahead market is proposed. The time-sequential Monte Carlo simulation is used to model the chronological characteristics of corresponding reliability network equivalents. A simplified method is also developed in the simulation procedures for improving the computational efficiency. The proposed technique can be used to evaluate customers’ reliabilities considering high penetration of wind power during the power system operation in the deregulated environment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Ding","given":"Yi"},{"family":"Cheng","given":"Lin"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yonghong"},{"family":"Xue","given":"Yusheng"}],"citation-key":"dingOperationalReliabilityEvaluation2014","container-title":"Journal of Modern Power Systems and Clean Energy","container-title-short":"J.

  {"id":"ditlevsenWarningForthcomingCollapse2023","abstract":"The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) is a major tipping element in the climate system and a future collapse would have severe impacts on the climate in the North Atlantic region. In recent years weakening in circulation has been reported, but assessments by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), based on the Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) model simulations suggest that a full collapse is unlikely within the 21st century. Tipping to an undesired state in the climate is, however, a growing concern with increasing greenhouse gas concentrations. Predictions based on observations rely on detecting early-warning signals, primarily an increase in variance (loss of resilience) and increased autocorrelation (critical slowing down), which have recently been reported for the AMOC. Here we provide statistical significance and data-driven estimators for the time of tipping. We estimate a collapse of the AMOC to occur around mid-century under the current scenario of future emissions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Ditlevsen","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Ditlevsen","given":"Susanne"}],"citation-key":"ditlevsenWarningForthcomingCollapse2023","container-title":"Nature Communications","container-title-short":"Nat Commun","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-023-39810-w","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,25]]},"language":"en","license":"2023 The Author(s)","number":"1","page":"4254","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Warning of a forthcoming collapse of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39810-w","volume":"14"},
  {"id":"dixitInvestmentHysteresis1992","abstract":"It seems that firms behave contrary to the standard economic theory of investment. We observe that firms do not invest as soon a price rises above long-run average cost; instead firms wait until price rises substantially above long-run average cost. On the downside, firms stay in business for lengthy periods while absorbing operating losses, and price can fall substantially below average variable cost without inducing disinvestment or exit. Recent developments in the theory of investment under uncertainty offer an interesting new explanation. The new approach builds on an interesting analogy between real investments and options in financial markets: In the timing of investment, waiting has positive value because time brings more information about the future prospects of a project. This new approach suggests that textbook pictures of the dynamics of a competitive industry need to be substantially redrawn. More generally, it says that a great deal of inertia is optimal when dynamic decisions are being made in an uncertain environment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Dixit","given":"Avinash"}],"citation-key":"dixitInvestmentHysteresis1992","container-title":"Journal of Economic Perspectives","DOI":"10.1257/jep.6.1.107","ISSN":"0895-3309","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1992",3]]},"language":"en","page":"107-132","source":"www.aeaweb.org","title":"Investment and Hysteresis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.6.1.107","volume":"6"},

  {"id":"dongNovelLCOEPricing2021","abstract":"To reach Carbon Peak in 2030 and Carbon Neutrality in 2060, China is developing renewable energy at a fast pace. Renewable energy enterprises will participate in the power market in an all-round way as China gradually improves its electricity market. Signing the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) helps renewable energy companies to avoid market risk and achieve sustainable development. Therefore, a novel PPA pricing model is proposed in our research. Based on the theory of the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE), our model considers system operating costs in China’s dual-track electric power sector, which is both government-guided and market-oriented. First of all, key influencing factors of the PPA agreement are analyzed in view of the developments of the renewable energy and electricity markets in China. Next, the design of pricing strategies for renewable energy power plants to cope with market challenges is presented through a photovoltaic project case study. The results show that when the operating costs of the system are considered and other conditions remain unchanged, the investment payback period of the new energy power station will change from 10.8 years to 13.6 years. Furthermore, correlation degree and sensitivity coefficient (SAF) were introduced to conduct correlation analysis and sensitivity analysis of key elements that affect the pricing of the PPA. Finally, it is concluded that the utilization hours of power generation have the most significant effect on the PPA price, while the system’s operating cost is the least sensitive factor. The study expands the application of LCOE, and provides a decision-making solution for the PPA pricing of renewable energy power enterprises. It is expected to help promote power transactions by renewable energy companies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Dong","given":"Jun"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Dongran"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yaoyu"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yuanyuan"},{"family":"Dou","given":"Xihao"}],"citation-key":"dongNovelLCOEPricing2021","container-title":"Processes","DOI":"10.3390/pr9101780","ISSN":"2227-9717","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",10]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"10","page":"1780","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"A Novel LCOE Pricing Model for Renewable Energy with Power Purchase Agreement: A Case Study in China","title-short":"A Novel LCOE Pricing Model for Renewable Energy with Power Purchase Agreement","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/9/10/1780","volume":"9"},

This paper presents a new AS framework being implemented at the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) in order to address the primary frequency control issues associated with the declining system inertia. This new design can balance the need for both reliability and economics while opening up the AS market to the traditional and non-traditional resources, including load resources with under-frequency relays and energy-limited resources like batteries.

To achieve this goal, the ECI defines the knowledge available in a location, as the average knowledge of the activities present in it, and the knowledge of an activity as the average knowledge of the places where that economic activity is conducted. The product equivalent of the Economic Complexity Index is the Product Complexity Index or PCI.\nHigher economic complexity as compared to country's income level drives economic development.

To that end, Saudi Arabia has been chosen for this case study. Over a project lifetime of 25 years, we find that, contrary to the widely accepted norm of 50% being a reasonable MSOC, a lower MSOC can bestow economic benefits. For example, a MSOC of 20% results in a lower number of batteries required throughout the lifetime of the project—while still meeting demand. For a village of 1000 homes, this translates to a saving of $47 million in net present value. Further, incorporating temperature effects results in deducing more realistic costs that are 125% higher than the ideal scenario (i.e., when temperature is not modeled). This difference stems from underestimating the actual number of batteries needed throughout the project lifetime. Compared to a diesel-powered microgrid, and for a village of 1000 homes, a PVB would, on an annual basis, avoid emitting 5000 tons of carbon and avoid burning 2 million liters of diesel.","author":[{"literal":"Elshurafa"},{"family":"Aldubyan","given":"Mohammad"}],"citation-key":"elshurafaStateofChargeEffectsStandalone2019","container-title":"Sustainability","container-title-short":"Sustainability","DOI":"10.3390/su11123471","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,24]]},"page":"3471","source":"ResearchGate","title":"State-of-Charge Effects on Standalone Solar-Storage Systems in Hot Climates: A Case Study in Saudi Arabia","title-short":"State-of-Charge Effects on Standalone Solar-Storage Systems in Hot Climates","type":"article-journal","volume":"11"},

Formulas are known for computing distances between different types of objects, such as the distance from a point to a line. In advanced mathematics, the concept of distance has been generalized to abstract metric spaces, and other distances than Euclidean have been studied. In some applications in statistics and optimization, the square of the Euclidean distance is used instead of the distance itself.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,27]]},"citation-key":"EuclideanDistance2022","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,3]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 1119874995","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Euclidean distance","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Euclidean_distance&oldid=1119874995"},

The first half of this paper therefore provides a summary review of some statistical models to help bridge the gap between these two approaches. The second half of the paper illustrates one possible assimilation using 1Cr1Mo-0.25V steel. The Wilshire equation for creep life prediction is integrated into a discrete hazard based statistical model—the former being chosen because of its novelty and proven capability in accurately predicting average failure times and the latter being chosen because of its flexibility in modelling the failure time distribution. Using this model it was found that, for example, if this material had been in operation for around 15 years at 823 K and 130 MPa, the chances of failure in the next year is around 35%. However, if this material had been in operation for around 25 years, the chance of failure in the next year rises dramatically to around 80%.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Evans","given":"Mark"}],"citation-key":"evansReviewStatisticalFailure2017","container-title":"Materials","container-title-short":"Materials (Basel)","DOI":"10.3390/ma10101190","ISSN":"1996-1944","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",10,17]]},"page":"1190","PMCID":"PMC5666996","PMID":"29039773","source":"PubMed Central","title":"A Review of Statistical Failure Time Models with Application of a Discrete Hazard Based Model to 1Cr1Mo-0.25V Steel for Turbine Rotors and Shafts","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5666996/","volume":"10"},

Many DER technologies employ inverters that can provide dynamic control of real and reactive power. Dynamic reactive power in distribution systems can yield improvements in efficiency, reliability, and reduction in demand charges for “behind the meter” installations. In order to determine the appropriate reactive power ratings for DER systems, developers and entrepreneurs must be able to calculate both the value of reactive power to customers and the marginal cost of adding or subtracting an increment of reactive power rating to a product. This study examines the marginal cost of various reactive power ratings for a 1 MW DER product presently under development by Rolls-Royce Fuel Cell Systems.","author":[{"family":"Fairfax","given":"Stephen"},{"family":"Dowling","given":"Neal"},{"family":"Healey","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Poole","given":"Katherine"}],"citation-key":"fairfaxMarginalCostReactive","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Marginal Cost of Reactive Power Capability in a 1 MW Distributed Energy Resource","type":"article-journal"},

Moreover, with the drastic increase in cooling and heating requirements in the building sector worldwide, the need for suitable technology that enables improvement in thermal performance of buildings is addressed. Utilizing phase change materials (PCMs) for thermal energy storage strategies in buildings can meet the potential thermal comfort requirements when selected properly. The current research article presents an overview of different PCM cooling applications in buildings. The reviewed applications are classified into active and passive systems. A summary of the used PCMs and their respective properties are presented as well. Primary results of the studied systems are demonstrated to be efficient in reducing indoor temperature fluctuations and energy demand during cold seasons along with the capability of triggering load reduction or shifting.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Faraj","given":"Khaireldin"},{"family":"Khaled","given":"Mahmoud"},{"family":"Faraj","given":"Jalal"},{"family":"Hachem","given":"Farouk"},{"family":"Castelain","given":"Cathy"}],"citation-key":"farajPhaseChangeMaterial2020","container-title":"Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews","container-title-short":"Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews","DOI":"10.1016/j.rser.2019.109579","ISSN":"13640321","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",3]]},"language":"en","page":"109579","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Phase change material thermal energy storage systems for cooling applications in buildings: A review","title-short":"Phase change material thermal energy storage systems for cooling applications in buildings","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1364032119307877","volume":"119"},

  {"id":"FinitestateMachine2023","abstract":"A finite-state machine (FSM) or finite-state automaton (FSA, plural: automata), finite automaton, or simply a state machine, is a mathematical model of computation. It is an abstract machine that can be in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time. The FSM can change from one state to another in response to some inputs; the change from one state to another is called a transition. An FSM is defined by a list of its states, its initial state, and the inputs that trigger each transition. Finite-state machines are of two types—deterministic finite-state machines and non-deterministic finite-state machines. A deterministic finite-state machine can be constructed equivalent to any non-deterministic one.\nThe behavior of state machines can be observed in many devices in modern society that perform a predetermined sequence of actions depending on a sequence of events with which they are presented. Simple examples are: vending machines, which dispense products when the proper combination of coins is deposited; elevators, whose sequence of stops is determined by the floors requested by riders; traffic lights, which change sequence when cars are waiting; combination locks, which require the input of a sequence of numbers in the proper order.\nThe finite-state machine has less computational power than some other models of computation such as the Turing machine. The computational power distinction means there are computational tasks that a Turing machine can do but an FSM cannot. This is because an FSM's memory is limited by the number of states it has. A finite-state machine has the same computational power as a Turing machine that is restricted such that its head may only perform \"read\" operations, and always has to move from left to right. FSMs are studied in the more general field of automata theory.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,5]]},"citation-key":"FinitestateMachine2023","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,24]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 1135387389","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Finite-state machine","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Finite-state_machine&oldid=1135387389"},

Here, we characterize several major themes emerging from this research and highlight some of the uptake of this work in both scientific and public spheres. Underpinning much of this research is the recognition that water resources are expected to undergo substantial changes based on the global warming that results primarily from fossil energy-based carbon emissions. At the same time, the production of electricity from fossil fuels, nuclear power, and some renewable technologies (biomass, geothermal and concentrating solar power) can be highly water-intensive. Energy choices now and in the near future will have a major impact not just on the global climate, but also on water supplies and the resilience of energy systems that currently depend heavily on them.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Frumhoff","given":"Peter C."},{"family":"Burkett","given":"Virginia"},{"family":"Jackson","given":"Robert B."},{"family":"Newmark","given":"Robin"},{"family":"Overpeck","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Webber","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"frumhoffVulnerabilitiesOpportunitiesNexus2015","container-title":"Environmental Research Letters","container-title-short":"Environ.

Relevant research articles are mostly based on battery external information, such as current, voltage, and temperature, which are susceptible to fluctuation and ultimately affects the SOH estimation accuracy. In this article, to solve these problems, a fast impedance calculation-based battery SOH estimation method for lithium-ion battery is proposed from the perspective of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The relationship between EIS and state of charge and that between EIS and degraded capacity is first studied by experimental tests. Some impedance features called health factors effectively indicating battery aging states are selected. Second, an improved fast Fourier transform (FFT) utilizing the conversion relationship between the real and complex signals is proposed to realize online fast EIS acquisition. Compared with ordinary FFT, such treatments reduce computational complexity. Then, the SOH evaluation model is built by the extreme learning machine with regularization mechanism, further reducing the computational burden. The relationship between the health factors and aging capacity of batteries is established. Finally, an experimental bench is established. The results indicate that the estimated SOH can be obtained within 35 s for a four-cell series-connected battery pack and the estimation errors are less than 2%.","author":[{"family":"Fu","given":"Yumeng"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Jun"},{"family":"Shi","given":"Mingjie"},{"family":"Mei","given":"Xuesong"}],"citation-key":"fuFastImpedanceCalculationBased2022","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","DOI":"10.1109/TIE.2021.3097668","ISSN":"1557-9948","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",7]]},"page":"7019-7028","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"A Fast Impedance Calculation-Based Battery State-of-Health Estimation Method","type":"article-journal","volume":"69"},

  {"id":"FunctionMathematics2022","abstract":"In mathematics, a function from a set X to a set Y assigns to each element of X exactly one element of Y. The set X is called the domain of the function and the set Y is called the codomain of the function.The earliest known approach to the notion of function can be traced back to works of Persian mathematicians Al-Biruni and Sharaf al-Din al-Tusi. Functions were originally the idealization of how a varying quantity depends on another quantity. For example, the position of a planet is a function of time. Historically, the concept was elaborated with the infinitesimal calculus at the end of the 17th century, and, until the 19th century, the functions that were considered were differentiable (that is, they had a high degree of regularity). The concept of a function was formalized at the end of the 19th century in terms of set theory, and this greatly enlarged the domains of application of the concept.\nA function is most often denoted by letters such as f, g and h, and the value of a function f at an element x of its domain is denoted by f(x); the numerical value resulting from the function evaluation at a particular input value is denoted by replacing x with this value; for example, the value of f at x = 4 is denoted by f(4). When the function is not named and is represented by an expression E, the value of the function at, say, x = 4 may be denoted by E|x=4. For example, the value at 4 of the function that maps x to \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        x\n        +\n        1\n        \n          )\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (x+1)^{2}}\n   may be denoted by \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n              (\n              x\n              +\n              1\n              \n                )\n                \n                  2\n                \n              \n            \n            |\n          \n          \n            x\n            =\n            4\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\left.(x+1)^{2}\\right\\vert _{x=4}}\n   (which results in 25).A function is uniquely represented by the set of all pairs (x, f (x)), called the graph of the function, a popular means of illustrating the function. When the domain and the codomain are sets of real numbers, each such pair may be thought of as the Cartesian coordinates of a point in the plane.\nFunctions are widely used in science, engineering, and in most fields of mathematics. It has been said that functions are \"the central objects of investigation\" in most fields of mathematics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,20]]},"citation-key":"FunctionMathematics2022","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,13]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 1121631286","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Function (mathematics)","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Function_(mathematics)&oldid=1121631286"},
  {"id":"gailaniLifetimeDegradationCost2020","abstract":"Capacity markets (CM) are energy markets created to ensure energy supply security. Energy storage devices provide services in the CMs. Li-ion batteries are a popular type of energy storage device used in CMs. The battery lifetime is a key factor in determining the economic viability of Li-ion batteries, and current approaches for estimating this are limited. This paper explores the potential of a lithium-ion battery to provide CM services with four de-rating factors (0.5 h, 1 h, 2 h, and 4 h). During the CM contract, the battery experiences both calendar and cycle degradation, which reduces the overall profit. Physics-based battery and degradation models are used to quantify the degradation costs for batteries in the CM to enhance the previous research results. The degradation model quantifies capacity losses related to the solid–electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer, active material loss, and SEI crack growth. The results show that the physics-based degradation model can accurately predict degradation costs under different operating conditions, and thus can substantiate the business case for the batteries in the CM. The simulated CM profits can be increased by 60% and 75% at 5 °C and 25 °C, respectively, compared to empirical and semiempirical degradation models. A sensitivity analysis for a range of parameters is performed to show the effects on the batteries’ overall profit margins.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Gailani","given":"Ahmed"},{"family":"Al-Greer","given":"Maher"},{"family":"Short","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Crosbie","given":"Tracey"},{"family":"Dawood","given":"Nashwan"}],"citation-key":"gailaniLifetimeDegradationCost2020","container-title":"Energies","DOI":"10.3390/en13112816","ISSN":"1996-1073","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"11","page":"2816","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Lifetime Degradation Cost Analysis for Li-Ion Batteries in Capacity Markets using Accurate Physics-Based Models","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/13/11/2816","volume":"13"},

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution by incorporating knowledge from external databases. This enhances the accuracy and credibility of the models, particularly for knowledge-intensive tasks, and allows for continuous knowledge updates and integration of domain-specific information. RAG synergistically merges LLMs' intrinsic knowledge with the vast, dynamic repositories of external databases. This comprehensive review paper offers a detailed examination of the progression of RAG paradigms, encompassing the Naive RAG, the Advanced RAG, and the Modular RAG. It meticulously scrutinizes the tripartite foundation of RAG frameworks, which includes the retrieval , the generation and the augmentation techniques. The paper highlights the state-of-the-art technologies embedded in each of these critical components, providing a profound understanding of the advancements in RAG systems. Furthermore, this paper introduces the metrics and benchmarks for assessing RAG models, along with the most up-to-date evaluation framework.

  {"id":"garcia-miguelReviewDegradationImplementation2022","abstract":"A naive battery operation optimization attempts to maximize short-term profits. However, it has been shown that this approach does not optimize long-term profitability, as it neglects battery degradation. Since a battery can perform a limited number of cycles during its lifetime, it may be better to operate the battery only when profits are on the high side. Researchers have dealt with this issue using various strategies to restrain battery usage, reducing short-term benefits in exchange for an increase in long-term profits. Determining this operation restraint is a topic scarcely developed in the literature. It is common to arbitrarily quantify degradation impact into short-term operation, which has proven to have an extensive impact on long-term results. This paper carries out a critical review of different methods of degradation control for short-time operation. A classification of different practices found in the literature is presented. Strengths and weaknesses of each approach are pointed out, and future possible contributions to this topic are remarked upon. The most common methodology is implemented in a simulation for demonstration purposes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,29]]},"author":[{"family":"García-Miguel","given":"Pedro Luis Camuñas"},{"family":"Alonso-Martínez","given":"Jaime"},{"family":"Arnaltes Gómez","given":"Santiago"},{"family":"García Plaza","given":"Manuel"},{"family":"Asensio","given":"Andrés Peña"}],"citation-key":"garcia-miguelReviewDegradationImplementation2022","container-title":"Batteries","DOI":"10.3390/batteries8090110","ISSN":"2313-0105","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",9]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"9","page":"110","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"A Review on the Degradation Implementation for the Operation of Battery Energy Storage Systems","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/9/110","volume":"8"},
  {"id":"garrettWorldEconomicProduction2020","abstract":"Climate change has become intertwined with the global economy. Here, we describe the contribution of inertia to future trends. Drawing from thermodynamic principles, and using 38 years of available statistics between 1980 to 2017, we find a constant scaling between current rates of world primary energy consumption E ( t ) and the historical time integral W of past world inflation-adjusted economic production Y, or W ( t ) = ∫ 0 t Y ( t ′ ) d t ′. In each year, over a period during which both E and W more than doubled, the ratio of the two remained nearly unchanged, that is λ = E ( t ) ( t ) / W ( t ) = 5 . 9 ± 0 . 1 Gigawatts per trillion 2010 US dollars. What this near constant implies is that current growth trends in energy consumption, population, and standard of living, perhaps counterintuitively, are determined by past innovations that have improved the economic production efficiency, or enabled use of less energy to transform raw materials into the makeup of civilization. Current observed growth rates agree well with predictions derived from available historical data. Future efforts to stabilize carbon dioxide emissions are likely also to be constrained by the contributions of past innovation to growth. Assuming no further efficiency gains, options look limited to rapid decarbonization of energy consumption through sustained implementation of at least one Gigawatt of renewable or nuclear power capacity per day. Alternatively, with continued reliance on fossil fuels, civilization could shift to a steady-state economy, one that devotes economic production exclusively to maintining ongoing metabolic needs rather than to material expansion. Even if such actions could be achieved immediately, energy consumption would continue at its current level, and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations would only begin to balance natural sinks at concentrations exceeding 500 ppmv.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Garrett","given":"Timothy J."},{"family":"Grasselli","given":"Matheus"},{"family":"Keen","given":"Stephen"}],"citation-key":"garrettWorldEconomicProduction2020","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0237672","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",8,27]]},"language":"en","page":"e0237672","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Past world economic production constrains current energy demands: Persistent scaling with implications for economic growth and climate change mitigation","title-short":"Past world economic production constrains current energy demands","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0237672","volume":"15"},

  {"id":"gialampoukiElectrochemicalMechanismsSolid2019","abstract":"In lithium-based batteries, the solid–electrolyte interphase (SEI) is a layer of material that forms between the negative electrode and the liquid electrolyte; it is produced spontaneously by the breakdown of electrolyte compounds at the highly reducing potentials inherent to these systems. The SEI is perhaps the most important factor controlling the efficiency, safety, and lifetime of lithium batteries, and many empirical approaches have been developed to control the SEI’s properties. In this work, we adapt methods from electrocatalysis to allow for the potential-dependent, atomistic simulation of SEI formation on lithium surfaces via electronic structure calculations. We use a computational lithium electrode (CLE) technique, in which the potential scale is thermodynamically linked to the lithium reference electrode, to study the decomposition of ethylene carbonate, one of the most prevalent battery electrolytes, into SEI components on lithium-based surfaces. On Li metal surfaces, we find that the most favorable process is forming the inorganic carbonate phases (accompanied by the liberation of ethylene gas), while forming the organic SEI component lithium ethylene dicarbonate (LiEDC) is unfavorable. In contrast, we find LiEDC to be favorable on the inorganic lithium surfaces (Li2CO3 and Li2O). This gives a mechanistic interpretation of a common physical picture of SEI formation: inorganic species (e.g., Li2CO3) are formed more heavily near the electrode, while organic species (e.g., LiEDC) are formed more heavily near the electrolyte. Both electrochemical and non-electrochemical pathways are explored and found to have similar energetics at this level of theory. This study rationalizes experimental findings and sets the stage for mechanism-based control of SEI formation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Gialampouki","given":"Martha A."},{"family":"Hashemi","given":"Javad"},{"family":"Peterson","given":"Andrew A."}],"citation-key":"gialampoukiElectrochemicalMechanismsSolid2019","container-title":"The Journal of Physical Chemistry C","container-title-short":"J.

  {"id":"gilbertProbabilisticLoadForecasting2023","abstract":"Short-term forecasts of energy consumption are invaluable for the operation of energy systems, including low voltage electricity networks. However, network loads are challenging to predict when highly desegregated to small numbers of customers, which may be dominated by individual behaviours rather than the smooth profiles associated with aggregate consumption. Furthermore, distribution networks are challenged almost entirely by peak loads, and tasks such as scheduling storage and/or demand flexibility maybe be driven by predicted peak demand, a feature that is often poorly characterised by general-purpose forecasting methods. Here we propose an approach to predict the timing and level of daily peak demand, and a data fusion procedure for combining conventional and peak forecasts to produce a general-purpose probabilistic forecast with improved performance during peaks. The proposed approach is demonstrated using real smart meter data and a hypothetical low voltage network hierarchy comprising feeders, secondary and primary substations. Fusing state-of-the-art probabilistic load forecasts with peak forecasts is found to improve performance overall, particularly at smart-meter and feeder levels and during peak hours, where improvement in terms of CRPS exceeds 10%.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Gilbert","given":"Ciaran"},{"family":"Browell","given":"Jethro"},{"family":"Stephen","given":"Bruce"}],"citation-key":"gilbertProbabilisticLoadForecasting2023","container-title":"Sustainable Energy, Grids and Networks","container-title-short":"Sustainable Energy, Grids and Networks","DOI":"10.1016/j.segan.2023.100998","ISSN":"2352-4677","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,14]]},"language":"en","page":"100998","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Probabilistic load forecasting for the low voltage network: Forecast fusion and daily peaks","title-short":"Probabilistic load forecasting for the low voltage network","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352467723000061"},

  {"id":"glenkCostDynamicsClean2021","abstract":"The pace of the global decarbonization process is widely believed to hinge on the rate of cost improvements for clean energy technologies, in particular renewable power and energy storage. This paper adopts the classical learning-by-doing framework of Wright (1936), which predicts that cost will fall as a function of the cumulative volume of past deployments. We first examine the learning curves for solar photovoltaic modules, wind turbines and electrolyzers. These estimates then become the basis for estimating the dynamics of the life-cycle cost of generating the corresponding clean energy, i.e., electricity from solar and wind power as well as hydrogen. Our calculations point to significant and sustained learning curves, which, in some contexts, predict a much more rapid cost decline than suggested by the traditional 80% learning curve. Finally, we argue that the observed learning curves for individual clean energy technologies reinforce each other in advancing the transition to a decarbonized energy economy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Glenk","given":"Gunther"},{"family":"Meier","given":"Rebecca"},{"family":"Reichelstein","given":"Stefan"}],"citation-key":"glenkCostDynamicsClean2021","container-title":"Schmalenbach Journal of Business Research","container-title-short":"Schmalenbach J Bus Res","DOI":"10.1007/s41471-021-00114-8","ISSN":"2366-6153","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"179-206","source":"Springer Link","title":"Cost Dynamics of Clean Energy Technologies","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s41471-021-00114-8","volume":"73"},

At that time, some macroeconomists were already searching for some alternative accounting foundations for macroeconomics. In the United States, Morris A. Copeland (1949), an institutionalist in the quantitative Mitchell tradition of the NBER, designed the first version of what became the flow-of-funds accounts now provided by the Federal Reserve since 1952 — the Z.1 accounts. Copeland wanted to have a framework that would allow him to answer simple but important questions such as: ‘When total purchases of our national product increase, where does the money come from to finance them? When purchases of our national product decline, what becomes of the money that is not spent?’ (Copeland 1949 (1996: 7)).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Godley","given":"Wynne"},{"family":"Lavoie","given":"Marc"}],"citation-key":"godleyBalanceSheetsTransaction2012","container-title":"Monetary Economics: An Integrated Approach to Credit, Money, Income, Production and Wealth","DOI":"10.1007/978-1-137-08599-3_2","editor":[{"family":"Godley","given":"Wynne"},{"family":"Lavoie","given":"Marc"}],"event-place":"London","ISBN":"978-1-137-08599-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"language":"en","page":"23-56","publisher":"Palgrave Macmillan UK","publisher-place":"London","source":"Springer Link","title":"Balance Sheets, Transaction Matrices and the Monetary Circuit","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-137-08599-3_2"},

In the circular flow approach, money is a device allowing transactions between agents to take place and illustrates Keynes’s famous ‘transactions’ motive for holding money. In the stock approach, money is seen as a financial asset which agents hold for investment purposes, or more precisely, as a placement as French scholars and Joan Robinson (1956: 8) say. The quantity of money held depends, in particular, on the rate of interest that can be obtained on other assets — an approach associated with Keynes’s ‘speculative’ and ‘precautionary’ motives. Agents make a portfolio choice between money and other possible financial assets. For this reason, the model developed in Chapter 4 is called Model PC, for portfolio choice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Godley","given":"Wynne"},{"family":"Lavoie","given":"Marc"}],"citation-key":"godleyGovernmentMoneyPortfolio2012","container-title":"Monetary Economics: An Integrated Approach to Credit, Money, Income, Production and Wealth","DOI":"10.1007/978-1-137-08599-3_4","editor":[{"family":"Godley","given":"Wynne"},{"family":"Lavoie","given":"Marc"}],"event-place":"London","ISBN":"978-1-137-08599-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"language":"en","page":"99-130","publisher":"Palgrave Macmillan UK","publisher-place":"London","source":"Springer Link","title":"Government Money with Portfolio Choice","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-137-08599-3_4"},

Our methodology differs from the usual textbook approach, according to which models of individual closed economies are eventually ‘opened’, but which give no consideration to what other countries must be held to be doing and how a full set of interactions between all countries might be characterized. The excuse is that the open economy under study is presumed to be small compared to the rest of the world, so that the feedback effects can be assumed to negligible. But then not much can be said about the US economy, the size of which surely guarantees large feedback effects on the rest of the world, nor about the European community or the block of Asian countries including Japan. This partial equilibrium approach is the more surprising because international trade theory is usually treated within a relatively sophisticated two-country and two-good framework.

  {"id":"godleyIntroduction2012","abstract":"During the 60-odd years since the death of Keynes there have existed two, fundamentally different, paradigms for macroeconomic research, each with its own fundamentally different interpretation of Keynes’s work.1 On the one hand there is the mainstream, or neo-classical, paradigm, which is based on the premise that economic activity is exclusively motivated by the aspirations of individual agents. At its heart this paradigm requires a neo-classical production function, which postulates that output is the result of combining labour with capital in such a way that, provided all markets clear, there will be no involuntary unemployment while the national income is distributed optimally and automatically between wages and profits. If markets do not clear because wages or prices are ‘sticky’, the same structure will generate determinate, if sub-optimal, disequilibrium outcomes and, for many economists, it is the possibility of such stickiness that defines Keynesian economics. The key assumption that individual welfare maximization is the universal mainspring is not consistent with the view that firms have an independent existence with distinct motivations, because optimum prices, output and employment are all decided for them by the location of aggregate demand and supply schedules. And as production is instantaneous, while supply is brought into equivalence with demand through the market-clearing process, there is no systemic need and therefore no essential place for loans, credit money or banks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Godley","given":"Wynne"},{"family":"Lavoie","given":"Marc"}],"citation-key":"godleyIntroduction2012","container-title":"Monetary Economics: An Integrated Approach to Credit, Money, Income, Production and Wealth","DOI":"10.1007/978-1-137-08599-3_1","editor":[{"family":"Godley","given":"Wynne"},{"family":"Lavoie","given":"Marc"}],"event-place":"London","ISBN":"978-1-137-08599-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"language":"en","page":"1-22","publisher":"Palgrave Macmillan UK","publisher-place":"London","source":"Springer Link","title":"Introduction","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-137-08599-3_1"},

The expansion has been generated by economic processes that are unsustainable—processes in private saving, private borrowing, and asset prices that have fueled the growth of demand against a negative impetus from both fiscal policy and net export demand. Given unchanged fiscal policy and the consensus forecast for growth in the rest of the world, continued expansion requires that private expenditure continue to expand relative to income on a record and growing scale. It seems impossible that this source of growth can be forthcoming indefinitely, although it may well continue into next year.

Official account imbalances are settled normally by transactions in dollar-denominated assets, with gold only playing a small role. International trade depends both on national output and relative prices, implying a distinction between nominal and real values.2 A minimum of five prices are considered: export prices, import prices, the price of sales, a domestic sales price and a GDP deflator. Fixed and flexible exchange rate regimes will both be explored. But many simplifying assumptions remain. There are only two countries, there is no domestic or foreign investment in fixed or working capital,3 firms do not hold financial assets, there is no endogenous wage inflation, there are no commercial banks or credit money, and the treatment of expectations is rudimentary.

Although private, or commercial, banks could also print cash money or banknotes, as they indeed were allowed to do in the past before central banks were awarded the monopoly, we shall assume that all private money takes the form of money deposits. We shall further assume that these bank deposits carry an interest yield.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Godley","given":"Wynne"},{"family":"Lavoie","given":"Marc"}],"citation-key":"godleySimpleModelPrivate2012","container-title":"Monetary Economics: An Integrated Approach to Credit, Money, Income, Production and Wealth","DOI":"10.1007/978-1-137-08599-3_7","editor":[{"family":"Godley","given":"Wynne"},{"family":"Lavoie","given":"Marc"}],"event-place":"London","ISBN":"978-1-137-08599-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"language":"en","page":"217-249","publisher":"Palgrave Macmillan UK","publisher-place":"London","source":"Springer Link","title":"A Simple Model with Private Bank Money","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-137-08599-3_7"},
  {"id":"godleySimplestModelGovernment2012","abstract":"Money is created in two fundamentally different ways. On the one hand there is outside money which is created whenever a government pays for something by making a draft on its central bank or by paying for something with banknotes, and which is extinguished when a payment is made by a member of the public to the government, typically in the form of taxes. This kind of money we may call government money, since it is issued by public institutions, namely the central bank or the Treasury department of central government. Government money is usually called central bank money or high-powered money in the literature. On the other hand there is inside money, which is created by commercial banks when they make loans, and which ceases to exist when loans are repaid. This second kind of money will be called private money, since it is issued by private institutions, namely private banks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Godley","given":"Wynne"},{"family":"Lavoie","given":"Marc"}],"citation-key":"godleySimplestModelGovernment2012","container-title":"Monetary Economics: An Integrated Approach to Credit, Money, Income, Production and Wealth","DOI":"10.1007/978-1-137-08599-3_3","editor":[{"family":"Godley","given":"Wynne"},{"family":"Lavoie","given":"Marc"}],"event-place":"London","ISBN":"978-1-137-08599-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"language":"en","page":"57-98","publisher":"Palgrave Macmillan UK","publisher-place":"London","source":"Springer Link","title":"The Simplest Model with Government Money","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-137-08599-3_3"},

Instead the chapter will be entirely devoted to the measurement of profits, costs and inventories, together with an analysis of the way in which firms’ pricing decisions distribute the national income. The subject matter is intricate and potentially controversial because there are so many ways in which accounts are kept. Our guiding light will be that the concepts and definitions will always meet the consistency requirements of the double entry matrices which underlie all our work. In particular, the definition of profits and the way in which appropriations are recorded must fit into a transactions matrix describing a whole economy so that all rows and all columns sum to zero.

  {"id":"grafWhatDrivesCapacity2022","abstract":"Battery energy storage systems (BESS) find increasing application in power grids to stabilise the grid frequency and time-shift renewable energy production. In this study, we analyse a 7.2 MW / 7.12 MWh utility-scale BESS operating in the German frequency regulation market and model the degradation processes in a semi-empirical way. Due to observing large temperature differences between the individual battery packs within a battery container, we include thermal effects in this model. In the analysed BESS the battery packs near the floor experience much lower temperatures in an annual average than the battery packs near the top (maximum average of 32 °C, minimum average of 23 °C). Operating in the Frequency Containment Reserve market, the annual capacity degradation differs up to 0.97% between the highest and lowest observed average temperatures. Hence, the BESS's lifetime could be extended by up to 11 years. Based on a detailed analysis of the BESS, we conclude that spatial temperature gradients within the battery containers are larger than expected and have a profound effect on lithium-ion battery ageing on system level. We extend this degradation model to study the technical potential of batteries in different energy market applications such as the day-ahead market with long periods of high charge and discharge rates (up to 1 h with a power to capacity ratio of 1 C) and the intraday market with volatile price spreads and therefore frequent and short periods (of up to 0.25 h) of high charge rates of up to 1 C. Our results suggest that the cooling system of energy storage systems needs to be carefully designed according to the intended application in order to control the temperature of the individual battery packs effectively. Slowing down ageing will be also beneficial for reusing 2nd life batteries stemming from a prior automotive application to extend the overall lifetime of such batteries.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Gräf","given":"David"},{"family":"Marschewski","given":"Julian"},{"family":"Ibing","given":"Lukas"},{"family":"Huckebrink","given":"David"},{"family":"Fiebrandt","given":"Marc"},{"family":"Hanau","given":"Götz"},{"family":"Bertsch","given":"Valentin"}],"citation-key":"grafWhatDrivesCapacity2022","container-title":"Journal of Energy Storage","container-title-short":"Journal of Energy Storage","DOI":"10.1016/j.est.2021.103533","ISSN":"2352-152X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"103533","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"What drives capacity degradation in utility-scale battery energy storage systems?

  {"id":"greerEconomicsEconometricsCost2012","abstract":"In general, a cost function describes the relationship between inputs, outputs, and other factors on total cost. It is critical to note that not every such relationship describes a proper cost function, which follows from the hypothesis of cost minimization. For multiproduct firms, the cost function should be able to accommodate output vectors in which some goods take on a value of 0, which is certainly the case throughout the cost function literature for electric utilities. The functional form of the cost function should not influence the analysis and resulting conclusions. Cost functions are often used to determine the optimal industry structure via concepts like economies of scale and scope, horizontal and vertical integration, and subadditivity of the cost function, which is a sufficient condition for natural monopoly. That is, the form itself must be flexible enough to allow for the emergence of these important cost concepts, which can then be used to shape industry structure and optimal policy making.","author":[{"family":"Greer","given":"Monica"}],"citation-key":"greerEconomicsEconometricsCost2012","DOI":"10.1016/B978-0-12-385134-5.00004-1","ISBN":"978-0-12-385134-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",12,31]]},"page":"101-132","source":"ResearchGate","title":"The Economics (and Econometrics) of Cost Modeling","type":"chapter"},

  {"id":"GroundcoupledHeatExchanger2023","abstract":"A ground-coupled heat exchanger is an underground heat exchanger that can capture heat from and/or dissipate heat to the ground. They use the Earth's near constant subterranean temperature to warm or cool air or other fluids for residential, agricultural or industrial uses. If building air is blown through the heat exchanger for heat recovery ventilation, they are called earth tubes (or Canadian well, Provençal well, Solar chimney, also termed earth cooling tubes, earth warming tubes, earth-air heat exchangers (EAHE or EAHX), air-to-soil heat exchanger, earth channels, earth canals, earth-air tunnel systems, ground tube heat exchanger, hypocausts, subsoil heat exchangers, thermal labyrinths, underground air pipes, and others).\nEarth tubes are often a viable and economical alternative or supplement to conventional central heating or air conditioning systems since there are no compressors, chemicals or burners and only blowers are required to move the air. These are used for either partial or full cooling and/or heating of facility ventilation air. Their use can help buildings meet Passive House standards or LEED certification.\nEarth-air heat exchangers have been used in agricultural facilities (animal buildings) and horticultural facilities (greenhouses) in the United States of America over the past several decades and have been used in conjunction with solar chimneys in hot arid areas for thousands of years, probably beginning in the Persian Empire. Implementation of these systems in India as well as in the cooler climates of Austria, Denmark and Germany to preheat the air for home ventilation systems has become fairly common since the mid-1990s, and is slowly being adopted in North America.\nGround-coupled heat exchanger may also use water or antifreeze as a heat transfer fluid, often in conjunction with a geothermal heat pump. See, for example downhole heat exchangers.

  {"id":"gunturSignaturesMitochondrialDysfunction2022","abstract":"Exercise intolerance is a major manifestation of post-acute sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection (PASC, or “long-COVID”). Exercise intolerance in PASC is associated with higher arterial blood lactate accumulation and lower fatty acid oxidation rates during graded exercise tests to volitional exertion, suggesting altered metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction. It remains unclear whether the profound disturbances in metabolism that have been identified in plasma from patients suffering from acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are also present in PASC. To bridge this gap, individuals with a history of previous acute COVID-19 infection that did not require hospitalization were enrolled at National Jewish Health (Denver, CO, USA) and were grouped into those that developed PASC (n = 29) and those that fully recovered (n = 16). Plasma samples from the two groups were analyzed via mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomics and compared against plasma metabolic profiles of healthy control individuals (n = 30). Observational demographic and clinical data were retrospectively abstracted from the medical record. Compared to plasma of healthy controls or individuals who recovered from COVID-19, PASC plasma exhibited significantly higher free- and carnitine-conjugated mono-, poly-, and highly unsaturated fatty acids, accompanied by markedly lower levels of mono-, di- and tricarboxylates (pyruvate, lactate, citrate, succinate, and malate), polyamines (spermine) and taurine. Plasma from individuals who fully recovered from COVID-19 exhibited an intermediary metabolic phenotype, with milder disturbances in fatty acid metabolism and higher levels of spermine and taurine. Of note, depletion of tryptophan—a hallmark of disease severity in COVID-19—is not normalized in PASC patients, despite normalization of kynurenine levels—a tryptophan metabolite that predicts mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. In conclusion, PASC plasma metabolites are indicative of altered fatty acid metabolism and dysfunctional mitochondria-dependent lipid catabolism. These metabolic profiles obtained at rest are consistent with previously reported mitochondrial dysfunction during exercise, and may pave the way for therapeutic intervention focused on restoring mitochondrial fat-burning capacity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Guntur","given":"Vamsi P."},{"family":"Nemkov","given":"Travis"},{"family":"Boer","given":"Esther","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Mohning","given":"Michael P."},{"family":"Baraghoshi","given":"David"},{"family":"Cendali","given":"Francesca I."},{"family":"San-Millán","given":"Inigo"},{"family":"Petrache","given":"Irina"},{"family":"D’Alessandro","given":"Angelo"}],"citation-key":"gunturSignaturesMitochondrialDysfunction2022","container-title":"Metabolites","DOI":"10.3390/metabo12111026","ISSN":"2218-1989","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",11]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"11","page":"1026","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Signatures of Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Impaired Fatty Acid Metabolism in Plasma of Patients with Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2218-1989/12/11/1026","volume":"12"},
  {"id":"guvenCostBasedApproachElicit2022","abstract":"Establishing separated markets for capacity, energy, and ancillary services (AS) is one of the key steps to liberalize electricity sector and realize electricity markets. This study aims at eliciting AS tariffs from unified capacity and energy tariffs through a cost-based approach. In the proposed framework, maintaining annual revenue requirements of the power plants is considered as the main objective while separating the AS tariff from unified tariffs. The conducted study considers two types of unified tariffs, i.e., capacity and energy tariffs, and offers proper AS eliciting scheme for each type of unified tariffs. The main challenges addressed here are: 1) incentivizing\\penalizing AS provision more\\less than scheduled amount which is tackled through an incentive factor, and 2) preventing overall tariff increment (customer tariff) after eliciting AS tariff which is addressed by applying fixing constraint to the overall tariff at before and after AS tariff eliciting conditions. Last but not the least, AS trade between adjacent utilities and calculating the benefits from this trade are addressed. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is assured through numerical investigations.","author":[{"family":"Guven","given":"Ali"},{"family":"Sezer","given":"Hikmet"},{"family":"Tör","given":"Osman"},{"family":"Cebeci","given":"Erkut"},{"family":"Teimourzadeh","given":"Saeed"}],"citation-key":"guvenCostBasedApproachElicit2022","container-title":"Balkan Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","container-title-short":"Balkan Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,1]]},"page":"53-68","source":"ResearchGate","title":"A Cost-Based Approach to Elicit Ancillary Service Tariffs from Unified Capacity and Energy Tariffs","type":"article-journal","volume":"10"},

Toward this, we formulate an optimization problem that co-optimizes real-time and energy reserve markets based on real-time and ancillary service market prices, along with available solar power, storage and demand data from each of the feeders within a single distribution network. The optimization, which includes all network system constraints, provides real/reactive power and energy storage set-points for each eeder as well as a schedule for the aggregate system’s participation in the two types of markets. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm using several trace-driven simulations based on a real-world circuit of a New Jersey utility. The results demonstrate that active participation through controllable loads and storage significantly reduces the utility’s net costs, i.e., real-time energy procurement costs minus ancillary market revenues.","author":[{"family":"Hajiesmaili","given":"Chengda Ji"},{"family":"Gayme","given":"Dennice F."},{"family":"Mallada","given":"Enrique"}],"citation-key":"hajiesmailiCoordinatingDistributionSystem2019","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","title":"Coordinating Distribution System Resources for Co-optimized Participation in Energy and Ancillary Service Transmission System Markets","type":"document","URL":"https://mallada.ece.jhu.edu/pubs/2019-ACC-JHGM.pdf"},

The previous research has mainly investigated SCED by formulating the problem in different modalities, e.g. preventive or corrective, and devising efﬁcient solutions for SCED. In this paper, we tackle a novel and important direction, and analyze the economic cost of incorporating security constraints in economic dispatch. Inspired by existing inefﬁciency metrics in game theory and computer science, we introduce notion of price of security as a metric that formally characterizes the economic inefﬁciency of SCED as compared to the original problem without security constraints. Then, we focus on the preventive approach in a simple topology comprising two buses and two lines, and investigate the impact of generation availability and demand distribution on the price of security. Moreover, we explicitly derive the worst-case input instance that leads to the maximum price of security. By experimental study on two test-cases, we verify the analytical results and provide insights for characterizing the price of security in general networks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Hajiesmaili","given":"Mohammad H."},{"family":"Cai","given":"Desmond"},{"family":"Mallada","given":"Enrique"}],"citation-key":"hajiesmailiUnderstandingInefficiencySecurityconstrained2017","container-title":"2017 IEEE 56th Annual Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)","DOI":"10.1109/CDC.2017.8263947","event-place":"Melbourne, Australia","event-title":"2017 IEEE 56th Annual Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)","ISBN":"978-1-5090-2873-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",12]]},"language":"en","page":"2035-2040","publisher":"IEEE","publisher-place":"Melbourne, Australia","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Understanding the inefficiency of security-constrained economic dispatch","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8263947/"},

  {"id":"hansenClimateSensitivitySea2013","abstract":"Cenozoic temperature, sea level and CO2 covariations provide insights into climate sensitivity to external forcings and sea-level sensitivity to climate change. Climate sensitivity depends on the initial climate state, but potentially can be accurately inferred from precise palaeoclimate data. Pleistocene climate oscillations yield a fast-feedback climate sensitivity of 3±1°C for a 4 W m−2 CO2 forcing if Holocene warming relative to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) is used as calibration, but the error (uncertainty) is substantial and partly subjective because of poorly defined LGM global temperature and possible human influences in the Holocene. Glacial-to-interglacial climate change leading to the prior (Eemian) interglacial is less ambiguous and implies a sensitivity in the upper part of the above range, i.e. 3–4°C for a 4 W m−2 CO2 forcing. Slow feedbacks, especially change of ice sheet size and atmospheric CO2, amplify the total Earth system sensitivity by an amount that depends on the time scale considered. Ice sheet response time is poorly defined, but we show that the slow response and hysteresis in prevailing ice sheet models are exaggerated. We use a global model, simplified to essential processes, to investigate state dependence of climate sensitivity, finding an increased sensitivity towards warmer climates, as low cloud cover is diminished and increased water vapour elevates the tropopause. Burning all fossil fuels, we conclude, would make most of the planet uninhabitable by humans, thus calling into question strategies that emphasize adaptation to climate change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Hansen","given":"James"},{"family":"Sato","given":"Makiko"},{"family":"Russell","given":"Gary"},{"family":"Kharecha","given":"Pushker"}],"citation-key":"hansenClimateSensitivitySea2013","container-title":"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences","DOI":"10.1098/rsta.2012.0294","issue":"2001","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",10,28]]},"page":"20120294","publisher":"Royal Society","source":"royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","title":"Climate sensitivity, sea level and atmospheric carbon dioxide","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsta.2012.0294","volume":"371"},

  {"id":"hasanpourNewApproachCost2009","abstract":"Power industry has been facing restructuring problems during the past decade. Appropriate management of reactive power is\nvery essential for supporting power system security. Reactive power has dominant effects on real energy transfer. Furthermore,\nit can support the secure operation of the system as an ancillary service. However, most researches have been focused on active\npower as the main good transacted in electricity markets. On the other hand, while reactive power production cost is highly\ndependent on real power output, it is mainly confined to local consumption. As a result, to avoid market power and to maintain\nthe secure operation of the system, a fair cost allocation method seems to be very essential. Appropriate pricing of reactive\npower as an ancillary service has been a challenging problem during the past decade. However, most methods proposed so far\nfor reactive power pricing are essentially based on empirical approximations. In this paper, a new method for reactive power\ncost allocation is proposed. The method is based on calculation of the accurate cost which will be imposed on generators due\nto supporting reactive power. The proposed method is fair, accurate and realistic and it can be formulated very easily. Furthermore,\na new approach based on tracing algorithm is proposed for pricing of reactive power which considers the cost of both active\nand reactive losses allocated to each generator. Application of the proposed method on IEEE 9-bus standard network confirms\nits validity and effectiveness.","author":[{"family":"Hasanpour","given":"Shirin"},{"family":"Ghazi","given":"Reza"},{"family":"Javidi","given":"Hossein"}],"citation-key":"hasanpourNewApproachCost2009","container-title":"Electrical Engineering","container-title-short":"Electrical Engineering","DOI":"10.1007/s00202-009-0113-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",6,1]]},"page":"27-34","source":"ResearchGate","title":"A new approach for cost allocation and reactive power pricing in a deregulated environment","type":"article-journal","volume":"91"},

Non-generating resources such as thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) can arbitrage energy prices and provide reserves due to their thermal energy storage capacity. The quantity of reserves depends not only on the aggregate power capacity, but also on information and communication technology, exogenous parameters, and system operator requirements. Specifically, the practical limitations origin from (i) communication constraints, (ii) ambient temperature, and (iii) the dispatch time of the activation signal. This study explores the impact of these parameters on the amount of reserves that an aggregator of TCLs can provide to the system operator based on centralised control of a TCL population. A decision support tool is proposed that can be used by aggregators to decide on maximum dispatchable reserve bids. The method can accommodate the specific control algorithm and TCL population of an aggregator and is based on offline computation. It constitutes a powerful reserve bid library to be used when optimisation tools become computationally intractable due to the increased number of decentralised flexible loads.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Herre","given":"Lars"},{"family":"Kazemi","given":"Syavash"},{"family":"Söder","given":"Lennart"}],"citation-key":"herreQuantifyingFlexibilityLoad2020","container-title":"IET Generation, Transmission & Distribution","DOI":"10.1049/iet-gtd.2020.0353","ISSN":"1751-8695","issue":"22","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","page":"5211-5218","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Quantifying flexibility of load aggregations: impact of communication constraints on reserve capacity","title-short":"Quantifying flexibility of load aggregations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1049/iet-gtd.2020.0353","volume":"14"},

This research constitutes a data update to LtG, by examining to what extent empirical data aligned with four LtG scenarios spanning a range of technological, resource, and societal assumptions. The research benefited from improved data availability since the previous updates and included a scenario and two variables that had not been part of previous comparisons. The two scenarios aligning most closely with observed data indicate a halt in welfare, food, and industrial production over the next decade or so, which puts into question the suitability of continuous economic growth as humanity's goal in the twenty‐first century. Both scenarios also indicate subsequent declines in these variables, but only one—where declines are caused by pollution—depicts a collapse. The scenario that aligned most closely in earlier comparisons was not amongst the two closest aligning scenarios in this research. The scenario with the smallest declines aligned least with empirical data; however, absolute differences were often not yet large. The four scenarios diverge significantly more after 2020, suggesting that the window to align with this last scenario is closing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Herrington","given":"Gaya"}],"citation-key":"herringtonUpdateLimitsGrowth2021","container-title":"Journal of Industrial Ecology","container-title-short":"J of Industrial Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/jiec.13084","ISSN":"1088-1980, 1530-9290","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6]]},"language":"en","page":"614-626","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Update to limits to growth: Comparing the World3 model with empirical data","title-short":"Update to limits to growth","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jiec.13084","volume":"25"},

  {"id":"hoeftThreeDimensionsStrategic2021","abstract":"Purpose Strategic flexibility is a widely discussed concept. Yet discussions remained of qualitative nature or addressed only specific aspects quantitatively underlying the concept. The purpose of this paper is to develop a conceptual model identifying key factors determining strategic flexibility. Once quantified, the model provides firms a profile of each strategic option towards the company vision. Design/methodology/approach The paper reviews existing and synthesises prior contributions into a conceptual model of strategic flexibility. Based on semi-structured interviews and value mapping, the model is applied using three case studies from the automotive industry. Findings A total of three main findings were made. First, the concept of strategic flexibility has a simple logic that aligns itself to a variety of automotive companies and visions. However, underlying this remit is an interplay of variables. Previous studies remain fragmented and have only addressed a subset of variables. Second, these variables can be grouped into three dimensions of strategic flexibility – product, process and customer – to convey a holistic understanding of strategic flexibility and its key determinants. Third, due to the uncertainty and complexity involved, depending on the firm and industry characteristics, there cannot be a one-fits-all configuration of the strategic flexibility conceptualisation. Research limitations/implications A variety of variables requires consideration to offer a balanced view of all three dimensions of strategic flexibility. Hence, the case studies remain at a necessarily high level. Practical implications The paper offers guidance for management on how to align their firm strategy to product and process contingency factors to satisfy customer needs in line with their company vision. Originality/value The paper aims to elevate a discussion that previously remained fragmented and mainly descriptive.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Hoeft","given":"Fabian"}],"citation-key":"hoeftThreeDimensionsStrategic2021","container-title":"International Journal of Organizational Analysis","DOI":"10.1108/IJOA-01-2021-2576","ISSN":"1934-8835","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,1]]},"page":"1728-1740","publisher":"Emerald Publishing Limited","source":"Emerald Insight","title":"The three dimensions of strategic flexibility","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1108/IJOA-01-2021-2576","volume":"30"},

  {"id":"howarthHowGreenBlue2021","abstract":"Hydrogen is often viewed as an important energy carrier in a future decarbonized world. Currently, most hydrogen is produced by steam reforming of methane in natural gas (“gray hydrogen”), with high carbon dioxide emissions. Increasingly, many propose using carbon capture and storage to reduce these emissions, producing so-called “blue hydrogen,” frequently promoted as low emissions. We undertake the first effort in a peer-reviewed paper to examine the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of blue hydrogen accounting for emissions of both carbon dioxide and unburned fugitive methane. Far from being low carbon, greenhouse gas emissions from the production of blue hydrogen are quite high, particularly due to the release of fugitive methane. For our default assumptions (3.5% emission rate of methane from natural gas and a 20-year global warming potential), total carbon dioxide equivalent emissions for blue hydrogen are only 9%-12% less than for gray hydrogen. While carbon dioxide emissions are lower, fugitive methane emissions for blue hydrogen are higher than for gray hydrogen because of an increased use of natural gas to power the carbon capture. Perhaps surprisingly, the greenhouse gas footprint of blue hydrogen is more than 20% greater than burning natural gas or coal for heat and some 60% greater than burning diesel oil for heat, again with our default assumptions. In a sensitivity analysis in which the methane emission rate from natural gas is reduced to a low value of 1.54%, greenhouse gas emissions from blue hydrogen are still greater than from simply burning natural gas, and are only 18%-25% less than for gray hydrogen. Our analysis assumes that captured carbon dioxide can be stored indefinitely, an optimistic and unproven assumption. Even if true though, the use of blue hydrogen appears difficult to justify on climate grounds.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Howarth","given":"Robert W."},{"family":"Jacobson","given":"Mark Z."}],"citation-key":"howarthHowGreenBlue2021","container-title":"Energy Science & Engineering","DOI":"10.1002/ese3.956","ISSN":"2050-0505","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","page":"1676-1687","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"How green is blue hydrogen?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ese3.956","volume":"9"},

These results are robust to uncertainty for the future capital cost scenario, but adiabatic compressed air and pumped thermal storage could be the least-cost technologies in the current capital cost scenario under uncertainty. Finally, we present a new storage system using heavy-duty vehicle fuel cells that could reduce the levelized cost of energy by 13%–20% compared with the best previously considered storage technology and, thus, could help enable very high (>80%) renewable energy grids.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Hunter","given":"Chad A."},{"family":"Penev","given":"Michael M."},{"family":"Reznicek","given":"Evan P."},{"family":"Eichman","given":"Joshua"},{"family":"Rustagi","given":"Neha"},{"family":"Baldwin","given":"Samuel F."}],"citation-key":"hunterTechnoeconomicAnalysisLongduration2021","container-title":"Joule","container-title-short":"Joule","DOI":"10.1016/j.joule.2021.06.018","ISSN":"2542-4351","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,18]]},"language":"en","page":"2077-2101","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Techno-economic analysis of long-duration energy storage and flexible power generation technologies to support high-variable renewable energy grids","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542435121003068","volume":"5"},

  {"id":"HydrogenSulfide2023","abstract":"Hydrogen sulfide is a chemical compound with the formula H2S. It is a colorless chalcogen-hydride gas, and is poisonous, corrosive, and flammable, with trace amounts in ambient atmosphere having a characteristic foul odor of rotten eggs. The underground mine gas term for foul-smelling hydrogen sulfide-rich gas mixtures is stinkdamp. Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele is credited with having discovered the chemical composition of purified hydrogen sulfide in 1777. The British English spelling of this compound is hydrogen sulphide, a spelling no longer recommended by the Royal Society of Chemistry or the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry.\nHydrogen sulfide is toxic to humans and most other animals by inhibiting cellular respiration in a manner similar to hydrogen cyanide. When it is inhaled or it or its salts are ingested in high amounts, damage to organs occurs rapidly with symptoms ranging from breathing difficulties to convulsions and death. Despite this, the human body produces small amounts of this sulfide and its mineral salts, and uses it as a signalling molecule.Hydrogen sulfide is often produced from the microbial breakdown of organic matter in the absence of oxygen, such as in swamps and sewers; this process is commonly known as anaerobic digestion, which is done by sulfate-reducing microorganisms. It also occurs in volcanic gases, natural gas deposits, and sometimes in well-drawn water.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,11]]},"citation-key":"HydrogenSulfide2023","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,6]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 1131944736","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Hydrogen sulfide","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hydrogen_sulfide&oldid=1131944736"},

  {"id":"idlbiCostBenefitAnalysisBattery2016","abstract":"The increasing distributed generation of renewable energies in distribution networks leads to several challenges for distribution network operators (DNOs). During high feed-in times, voltage violations can occur if the hosting capacity of the grid for distributed generation is exceeded. The paper at hand investigates the installation of grid-supporting battery storage system (BSS) in the medium voltage (MV) level to serve mainly for voltage compliance and to defer grid reinforcement. A control approach for the BSS based on two characteristic curves is suggested. The BSS is then analyzed technically and economically for scenarios of high distributed generation. The results show that the alternative of BSS has potential to defer grid reinforcement in the presented case studies. However, the power curtailment is more viable than the BSS and grid reinforcement. The economic viability of BSS can increase in the future based on the expected reduction of battery costs. Furthermore, BSS have the technical potential for providing other services, since voltage violations occur during high feed-in times.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Idlbi","given":"Basem"},{"family":"Appen","given":"Jan","non-dropping-particle":"von"},{"family":"Kneiske","given":"Tanja"},{"family":"Braun","given":"Martin"}],"citation-key":"idlbiCostBenefitAnalysisBattery2016","collection-title":"10th International Renewable Energy Storage Conference, IRES 2016, 15-17 March 2016, Düsseldorf, Germany","container-title":"Energy Procedia","container-title-short":"Energy Procedia","DOI":"10.1016/j.egypro.2016.10.112","ISSN":"1876-6102","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"215-228","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Cost-Benefit Analysis of Battery Storage System for Voltage Compliance in Distribution Grids with High Distributed Generation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876610216310736","volume":"99"},
  {"id":"igweUsualDietaryAnthocyanin2019","abstract":"Background: Anthocyanins represent an important subgroup of non-nutritive components of food as evidence continues to build related to their beneficial bioactive effects. Using a recently developed Australian anthocyanin database, the present study aimed to estimate the intake of both total anthocyanins and their subclasses, identify food sources of anthocyanins, and determine associations between anthocyanin intake and measured blood pressure (BP).\nMethods: The present study comprised was a secondary analysis of the 2011-12 National Nutrition and Physical Activity component of the Australian Health Survey. Anthocyanin intake was estimated using an Australian anthocyanin database. Usual anthocyanin intake, as estimated from 24-h diet recall data, was computed using multiple source methods, whereas food sources were determined by calculating contribution of food groups to total anthocyanin intake. Regression analysis, adjusted for covariates (age, gender, body mass index, high BP) diagnosis, smoking status and physical activity) assessed the relationship between anthocyanin intake and BP in adults aged ≥50 years.\nResults: Mean anthocyanin intake was 24.17 ± 0.32 mg day −1 . Across age groups, berries were the top sources: blackberry (5-65%), cherry (2-24%), blueberry (2-13%) and raspberry (3-12%). There was a significant inverse association between anthocyanin intake and systolic BP (β = −0.04, F = 16.8, d.f. = 6, r2 = 0.05, P < 0.01) and diastolic BP (β = 0.01, F = 5.35, d.f. = 6, R2 = 0.013, P < 0.01), in models that adjusted for covariates.\nConclusions: In comparison with the world composite database, anthocyanin intake in the Australian population was above average [mean (SD): 24.17 (0.32) mg day−1 versus 18.05 (21.14) mg day−1]. Berries comprised up the primary source of anthocyanins. Anthocyanin intake in older adults aged aged ≥50 years was inversely associated with BP.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Igwe","given":"E.

  {"id":"Information2022","abstract":"Information is an abstract concept that refers to that which has the power to inform.  At the most fundamental level information pertains to the interpretation of that which may be sensed.  Any natural process that is not completely random, and any observable pattern in any medium can be said to convey some amount of information.  Whereas digital signals and other data use discrete signs to convey information, other phenomena and artifacts such as analog signals, poems, pictures, music or other sounds, and currents convey information in a more continuous form.  Information is not knowledge itself, but the meaning that may be derived from a representation through interpretation.Information is often processed iteratively: Data available at one step are processed into information to be interpreted and processed at the next step.  For example, in written text each symbol or letter conveys information relevant to the word it is part of, each word conveys information relevant to the phrase it is part of, each phrase conveys information relevant to the sentence it is part of, and so on until at the final step information is interpreted and becomes knowledge in a given domain.  In a digital signal bits may be interpreted into the symbols, letters, numbers, or structures that convey the information available at the next level up.  The key characteristic of information is that it is subject to interpretation and processing.\nThe concept of information is relevant in various contexts, including those of constraint, communication, control, data, form, education, knowledge, meaning, understanding, mental stimuli, pattern, perception, proposition, representation, and entropy.\nThe derivation of information from a signal or message may be thought of as the resolution of ambiguity or uncertainty that arises during the interpretation of patterns within the signal or message.Information may be structured as data. Redundant data can be compressed up to an optimal size, which is the theoretical limit of compression.\nThe information available through a collection of data may be derived by analysis.  For example, data may be collected from a single customer's order at a restaurant.  The information available from many orders may be analyzed, and then becomes knowledge that is put to use when the business subsequently is able to identify the most popular or least popular dish.Information can be transmitted in time, via data storage, and space, via communication and telecommunication. Information is expressed either as the content of a message or through direct or indirect observation. That which is perceived can be construed as a message in its own right, and in that sense, all information is always conveyed as the content of a message.\nInformation can be encoded into various forms for transmission and interpretation (for example, information may be encoded into a sequence of signs, or transmitted via a signal). It can also be encrypted for safe storage and communication.\nThe uncertainty of an event is measured by its probability of occurrence. Uncertainty is inversely proportional to the probability of occurrence. Information theory takes advantage of this by concluding that more uncertain events require more information to resolve their uncertainty. The bit is a typical unit of information. It is 'that which reduces uncertainty by half'. Other units such as the nat may be used. For example, the information encoded in one \"fair\" coin flip is log2(2/1) = 1 bit, and in two fair coin flips is log2(4/1) = 2 bits. A 2011 Science article estimated that 97% of technologically stored information was already in digital bits in 2007, and that the year 2002 was the beginning of the digital age for information storage (with digital storage capacity bypassing analog for the first time).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,23]]},"citation-key":"Information2022","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,20]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 1122937687","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Information","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Information&oldid=1122937687"},

  {"id":"InnovationSignalProcessing2021","abstract":"In time series analysis (or forecasting) — as conducted in statistics, signal processing, and many other fields — the innovation is the difference between the observed value of a variable at time t and the optimal forecast of that value based on information available prior to time t.  If the forecasting method is working correctly, successive innovations are uncorrelated with each other, i.e., constitute a white noise time series.  Thus it can be said that the innovation time series is obtained from the measurement time series by a process of 'whitening', or removing the predictable component. The use of the term innovation in the sense described here is due to Hendrik Bode and Claude Shannon (1950) in their discussion of the Wiener filter problem, although the notion was already implicit in the work of Kolmogorov.In contrast, the residual is the difference between the observed value of a variable at time t and the optimal updated state of that value based on information available till (including) time t.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,23]]},"citation-key":"InnovationSignalProcessing2021","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,19]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 1023950065","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Innovation (signal processing)","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Innovation_(signal_processing)&oldid=1023950065"},

  {"id":"kaiserRiskPredictionModels2020","abstract":"The rising incidence of cutaneous melanoma over the past few decades has prompted substantial efforts to develop risk prediction models identifying people at high risk of developing melanoma to facilitate targeted screening programs. We review these models, regarding study characteristics, differences in risk factor selection and assessment, evaluation, and validation methods. Our systematic literature search revealed 40 studies comprising 46 different risk prediction models eligible for the review. Altogether, 35 different risk factors were part of the models with nevi being the most common one (n = 35, 78%); little consistency in other risk factors was observed. Results of an internal validation were reported for less than half of the studies (n = 18, 45%), and only 6 performed external validation. In terms of model performance, 29 studies assessed the discriminative ability of their models; other performance measures, e.g., regarding calibration or clinical usefulness, were rarely reported. Due to the substantial heterogeneity in risk factor selection and assessment as well as methodologic aspects of model development, direct comparisons between models are hardly possible. Uniform methodologic standards for the development and validation of risk prediction models for melanoma and reporting standards for the accompanying publications are necessary and need to be obligatory for that reason.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Kaiser","given":"Isabelle"},{"family":"Pfahlberg","given":"Annette B."},{"family":"Uter","given":"Wolfgang"},{"family":"Heppt","given":"Markus V."},{"family":"Veierød","given":"Marit B."},{"family":"Gefeller","given":"Olaf"}],"citation-key":"kaiserRiskPredictionModels2020","container-title":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","container-title-short":"Int J Environ Res Public Health","DOI":"10.3390/ijerph17217919","ISSN":"1661-7827","issue":"21","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",11]]},"page":"7919","PMCID":"PMC7662952","PMID":"33126677","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Risk Prediction Models for Melanoma: A Systematic Review on the Heterogeneity in Model Development and Validation","title-short":"Risk Prediction Models for Melanoma","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7662952/","volume":"17"},

  {"id":"karunakaranELECTRICPOWERGRID2014","abstract":"The current worth of the power industry worldwide pegged at six trillion dollars. The cost of power plants are so high that only politicians of the highest level can make decisions on which to choose. The problem is that there are few engineers in the very top levels of politics worldwide and this is especially so in the developing countries. Incorrect political decisions with regard to facilities within the power grid can cause sufferings to the people of developing countries as debt creeps into their lives. This paper therefore aims to be a guide for politicians in developing countries to wisely choose the appropriate power plants unbiasedly. This is done by depicting the electric power decisions made in the state of Sarawak, Malaysia as well as of designs to further improve this grid. Sarawak has used some of the best minds in the world to develop a large and exemplary grid. Currently politicians in developing countries tend to get consultants from major corporations aboard. Every activity of large corporations must lead to maximum profit for themselves, often to detriment of the host developing country.","author":[{"family":"Karunakaran","given":"Prashobh"}],"citation-key":"karunakaranELECTRICPOWERGRID2014","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"ELECTRIC POWER GRID OPTIMIZATION FOR THE STATE OF SARAWAK AS AN EXAMPLE FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"katsapisTechnoeconomicAnalysisPredictive2018","abstract":"Modern gas turbines are featured with cooling air systems that allow them to operate at temperatures much higher than the melting points of most of their hot gas path components. When these systems degrade, creep life consumption is accelerated. If the risk is not assessed and managed in time, the engine could operate with high lifting risk. In the world of power industry, the operators are in most cases presented with two options when a lifting risk in their engine is identified. They can undertake a forced opening of the engine, against their existing planning of maintenance events, aiming to re-instate cooling air system’s functionality. Alternatively, they can derate the engine, by decreasing \nfiring temperature, to a level that will allow continuous operation until the next planned overhaul event. \nThe model presented in this work allows the operator to follow a third path. The operator can still manage effectively the lifting risk but also, critically, to do it in a commercially optimised way by taking into consideration electricity market conditions and the incentives that the market may present. This is important as this model fills a gap in the relevant research where the majority of the works are focused in managing lifting risks through a binary time-interval-reduction or firing- temperature-decrease approach. \nThe developed in this work tool uses a combination of performance modelling, analytical and computational methods, as well as Monte Carlo simulations. The cooling air system degradation is detected and assessed and the effect on cooling air temperature is determined with use of CFD. The impact on blades metal temperature is calculated with a combination of analytical model and Monte Carlo simulations. In a similar combination of analytical method and Monte Carlo, stress is calculated and together with OEM’s life expectancy, a creep life estimation model then is derived. The lifting risk is quantified and appropriate mitigation is proposed. The mitigation is in the form of a novel method, which uses market triggered factors to adjust dynamically engine’s firing temperature and define by this way engine’s performance. This hybrid approach results is an optimised operation in which the lifting risk is effectively managed, the original maintenance planning is respected and, critically, the commercial losses due to engine derate are significantly trimmed. The tool, with its risk-versus-value function, allows the operator to exercise a more or less conservative operation, following a case-by-case approach.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Katsapis","given":"Vasileios"}],"citation-key":"katsapisTechnoeconomicAnalysisPredictive2018","event-place":"UK","genre":"Thesis","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",10]]},"language":"en","license":"© Cranfield University, 2015.

  {"id":"kimOralSupplementationLowMolecularWeight2022","abstract":"Orally administered collagen peptides could contribute to antiaging by replacing the degraded extracellular matrix proteins caused by photoaging. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of low-molecular-weight collagen peptides for treating photoaged and dry skin. In this randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, double-blinded trial, we randomly assigned study participants (n = 100) to either the test product group or placebo group at a 1:1 ratio for 12 weeks. The wrinkle scale score, eye wrinkle volume, roughness parameters, such as the average maximum height of the wrinkle (Rz), arithmetic average within the total measuring length of the wrinkle (Ra), maximum profile valley depth of the wrinkle (Rv), and skin hydration, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), overall elasticity (R2), and ratio of elastic recovery to total deformation (R7) were evaluated at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks. Safety assessments with serial blood tests were also conducted. Efficacy assessments of data from 84 participants were conducted as the per-protocol analysis. After 12 weeks, the 10-grade crow's feet photo scale score, eye wrinkle volume, skin roughness parameters (Rz, Ra, and Rv), skin elasticity (R2 and R7), skin hydration, and TEWL were significantly improved in the test product group compared to the placebo group.

  {"id":"klansuparOptimalSizingGridScaled2022","abstract":"Variable renewable energy (VRE) generation changes the shape of residual demand curves, contributing to the high operating costs of conventional generators. Moreover, the variable characteristics of VRE cause a mismatch between electricity demand and power generation, resulting in a greater expected energy not supplied (EENS) value. EENS involves an expected outage cost, which is one of the important components of power-generation costs. A utility-scale battery energy storage system (BESS) is popularly used to provide ancillary services to mitigate the VRE impact. The general BESS ancillary-service applications are as a spinning reserve, for regulation, and for ramping. A method to determine optimal sizing and the optimal daily-operation schedule of a grid-scale BESS (to compensate for the negative impacts of VRE in terms of operating costs, power-generation-reliability constraints, avoided expected-outage costs, and the installation cost of the BESS) is proposed in this paper. Moreover, the optimal BESS application at a specific time during the day can be selected. The method is based on a multiple-BESS-applications unit-commitment problem (MB-UC), which is solved by mixed-integer programming (MIP). The results show a different period for a BESS to operate at its best value in each application, and more benefits are found when operating the BESS in multiple applications.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Klansupar","given":"Chalermjit"},{"family":"Chaitusaney","given":"Surachai"}],"citation-key":"klansuparOptimalSizingGridScaled2022","container-title":"Energies","DOI":"10.3390/en15134742","ISSN":"1996-1073","issue":"13","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"13","page":"4742","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Optimal Sizing of Grid-Scaled Battery with Consideration of Battery Installation and System Power-Generation Costs","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/13/4742","volume":"15"},

The main drivers of these cost reductions are an increased current density and a reduction and/or replacement of expensive materials with cheaper alternatives. To a lesser extent, manufacturing and labor costs reduction is expected due to mass manufacturing at a GW scale. The total cost decrease is less prominent for AE than PEM due to AE's maturity.

The V-shaped Arrhenius plots show minima at an optimum temperature corresponding to the longest cycle-life. The V-shape of the Arrhenius plots signifies the crossover between the two dominating ageing mechanisms – solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) growth in the high temperature range and lithium deposition in the low temperature range. Subjects of our investigations are commercial 5 Ah high energy 21,700-type cells with LiNi0.90Co0.05Al0.05O2 + LiNiO2 (NCA + LNO) cathode and Si/graphite anode (∼3% Si) and 0.1 Ah lab-made pouch cells with LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 (NMC111) cathode and a graphite anode. The results of the Arrhenius plots are analysed in the context of C-rate, cell ageing, and electrode properties. We find that the crossover between the dominating ageing mechanism and hence the optimum operating temperature of the Li-ion cells depend on C-rate, anode coating thickness/particles sizes, the state of health, and the shape of the capacity fade curve. Considering the change of the dominant ageing mechanism can help designing battery systems with longer service life. Additionally, we show a lifetime estimation for temperature dependent cycling of batteries emphasizing the merit of Arrhenius plots in the context of battery cell ageing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Kucinskis","given":"Gints"},{"family":"Bozorgchenani","given":"Maral"},{"family":"Feinauer","given":"Max"},{"family":"Kasper","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Wohlfahrt-Mehrens","given":"Margret"},{"family":"Waldmann","given":"Thomas"}],"citation-key":"kucinskisArrheniusPlotsLiion2022","container-title":"Journal of Power Sources","container-title-short":"Journal of Power Sources","DOI":"10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.232129","ISSN":"0378-7753","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,30]]},"language":"en","page":"232129","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Arrhenius plots for Li-ion battery ageing as a function of temperature, C-rate, and ageing state – An experimental study","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378775322011065","volume":"549"},
  {"id":"kumarAncillaryServicesIndian2021","abstract":"Reliable and secure operation of a power system depends on the ability of system operation to address system imbalances on account of demand-supply imbalances and that an account of change in availability of transmission network elements. The impact of a power plant or transmission line failures causes a short-term imbalance between generation and demand, and balance can be addressed by deploying flexible reserves and ancillary services. The system imbalances in the Indian power system operation are addressed through Deviation Settlement Mechanism, a commercial mechanism based on a frequency linked incentive/penalty structure. Implementation of reserve regulation ancillary services in India has further helped to address deviation in frequency, congestion, and to bring grid resilience. This paper discusses the development of ancillary services in India, alongside crucial developments in the power market. Given the ongoing developments in the Indian power market and international experiences, this paper suggests a road map for further development of the ancillary services market in the country. The Indian power system has also witnessed a significant growth of variable renewable energy resources. In the future, renewable resources are expected to provide full range ancillary services ensuring the least cost, supply security, and high availability of reserves. Deviations on account of uncertainty associated with renewable resource generation are also subject to Deviation Settlement Mechanism, although with lenient penalties.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Kumar","given":"T.

The change from dispatchable generation to an environment in which Independent System Operators (ISOs), Regional Transmission Operators (RTOs), Load Serving Entities (LSEs) and consumers dynamically respond to the conditions in the system and help to alleviate the uncertainty linked to RES requires appropriate tools to evaluate the social benefits and costs of different policies implemented. This paper presents a framework for evaluating the aforementioned effects using an engineering and economic optimization model. The proposed framework is applied to a stylized case study with operations on a test network that simulates a typical day. The objective of the case study is to compare the effects of (1) controllable demand, (2) on-site storage, and (3) upgrading transmission capacity. The different scenarios are evaluated in terms of (1) the percentage of potential wind generation spilled, (2) the total operating cost of production, and (3) the amount of installed capacity needed to maintain operating reliability. The results show that controllable demand improves (reduces) all of the three criteria by alleviating congestion and mitigating wind variability. In contrast, the beneficial effects are smaller for RES's on-site storage, because it does not shift load to off-peak periods or reduce congestion, and for upgrading transmission, because it does not shift load to off-peak periods or mitigate wind variability.","author":[{"family":"Lamadrid","given":"Alberto"},{"family":"Mount","given":"Timothy"}],"citation-key":"lamadridAncillaryServicesSystems2012","container-title":"Energy Economics","container-title-short":"Energy Economics","DOI":"10.1016/j.eneco.2012.08.011","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",11,1]]},"page":"1959–1971","source":"ResearchGate","title":"Ancillary services in systems with high penetrations of renewable energy sources, the case of ramping","type":"article-journal","volume":"34"},

  {"id":"laslettSimpleHourlyWind2016","abstract":"A simple simulator capable of generating synthetic hourly values of wind power was developed for the South West region of Western Australia. The global Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) atmospheric database was used to calibrate the simulation with wind speeds 50 m above ground level. Analysis of the MERRA data indicated that the normalised residual of hourly wind speed had a double exponential distribution. A translated square-root transformation function was used to convert this to a normal-like distribution so that autoregressive (AR) time series analysis could be used. There was a significant dependency in this time series on the last 3 h m so a third order AR model was used to generate hourly 50 m wind speed residuals. The MERRA daily average 50 m wind speed was found to have a Weibull-like distribution, so a square root conversion was used on the data to obtain a normal distribution. The time series for this distribution was found to have a significant dependency on the values for the last two days, so a second order AR model was also used in the simulation to generate synthetic time series values for the square root of the daily average wind speed. Seasonal, daily, diurnal, and hourly components were added to generate synthetic time series values of total 50 m wind speed. To scale this wind speed to turbine hub height, a time varying wind shear factor model was created and calibrated using measured data at a coastal and an inland site. Standard wind turbine power curves were modified to produce an estimate of wind farm power output from the hub-height wind speed. Comparison with measured grid supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data indicated that the simulation generated conservative power output values. The simulation was compared to two other models: a Weibull distribution model, and an AR model with normally distributed residuals. The statistical fit with the SCADA data was found to be closer than these two models. Spatial correlation using only the MERRA data was found to be higher than the SCADA data, indicating that there is still a further source of variability to be accounted for. Hence the simulation spatial correlation was calibrated to previously reported findings, which were similar to the SCADA data.","author":[{"family":"Laslett","given":"Dean"},{"family":"Creagh","given":"Chris"},{"family":"Jennings","given":"Philip"}],"citation-key":"laslettSimpleHourlyWind2016","container-title":"Renewable Energy","container-title-short":"Renewable Energy","DOI":"10.1016/j.renene.2016.05.024","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",10,1]]},"page":"1003-1014","source":"ResearchGate","title":"A simple hourly wind power simulation for the South-West region of Western Australia using MERRA data","type":"article-journal","volume":"96"},

  {"id":"layadiLifetimeEstimationTool2015","abstract":"Generally, battery lifespan depends on the number of cycles and depth of discharge (DOD). Nevertheless, in a renewable hybrid power system, charge and discharge cycles are random and not regular. Therefore, it is important to develop an aging model suitable to this case. Thus, in this paper, a pertinent way for aging lead–acid batteries connected to a stand-alone multi-source renewable system has been developed. It is based on the Rain Flow method for counting cycles and considers instantaneous DOD and average temperature. In fact, for each functioning year, a classification of the number of cycles according to the DOD is done. Then, based on these data, the battery degradation rate is estimated so that it is possible to draw conclusions about battery lifespan.\n\nThe method has been successfully applied to a multi-source power system simulated dynamically under Matlab/Simulink. This last takes into account with good accuracy several inputs and elements such as sun irradiation, wind speed, load profile, photovoltaic generator, wind turbine, and diesel generator. Results show the influence of the DOD and the batteries nominal capacity on their lifespan. A mean of eight years’ life is detected. Finally, a reasonable over-sizing may favor battery longevity.","author":[{"family":"Layadi","given":"Toufik"},{"family":"Champenois","given":"Gerard"},{"family":"Mohammed","given":"Mostefai"},{"family":"Abbes","given":"Dhaker"}],"citation-key":"layadiLifetimeEstimationTool2015","container-title":"Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory","container-title-short":"Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory","DOI":"10.1016/j.simpat.2015.03.001","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",5,1]]},"page":"36-48","source":"ResearchGate","title":"Lifetime estimation tool of lead–acid batteries for hybrid power sources design","type":"article-journal","volume":"54"},

However, the comprehensive effects of temperature on the cyclic aging rate of LiB have yet to be found. We use an electrochemistry-based model (ECBE) here to measure the effects on the aging behavior of cycled LiB operating within the temperature range of 25 °C to 55 °C. The increasing degradation rate of the maximum charge storage of LiB during cycling at elevated temperature is found to relate mainly to the degradations at the electrodes, and that the degradation of LCO cathode is larger than graphite anode at elevated temperature. In particular, the formation and modification of the surface films on the electrodes as well as structural/phase changes of the LCO electrode, as reported in the literatures, are found to be the main contributors to the increasing degradation rate of the maximum charge storage of LiB with temperature for the specific operating temperature range. Larger increases in the Warburg elements and cell impedance are also found with cycling at higher temperature, but they do not seriously affect the state of health (SoH) of LiB as shown in this work.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Leng","given":"Feng"},{"family":"Tan","given":"Cher Ming"},{"family":"Pecht","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"lengEffectTemperatureAging2015","container-title":"Scientific Reports","container-title-short":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/srep12967","ISSN":"2045-2322","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",8,6]]},"page":"12967","PMCID":"PMC4526891","PMID":"26245922","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Effect of Temperature on the Aging rate of Li Ion Battery Operating above Room Temperature","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4526891/","volume":"5"},

The variability of these resources creates challenges in balancing the system generation and demand, and ensuring resource adequacy and essential reliability services. The inverter-based nature of wind and solar PV leads to challenges in frequency, transient, and small-signal stability. In this study, seven system operators demonstrate the ability to manage these challenges in a variety of power systems, from stand-alone island systems to larger island systems that are interconnected to neighbours, to balancing authorities that are strongly interconnected within very large synchronous systems. They operate within a variety of market constructs, from full regional transmission operators to vertically-integrated utilities.

  {"id":"liBriefClimatologyDunkelflaute2021","abstract":"In the coming decades, the European energy system is expected to become increasingly reliant on non-dispatchable generation such as wind and solar power. Under such a renewable energy scenario, a better characterization of the extreme weather condition ‘Dunkelflaute’, which can lead to a sustained reduction of wind and solar power, is important. In this paper, we report findings from the very first climatological study of Dunkelflaute events occurring in eleven countries surrounding the North and Baltic Sea areas. By utilizing multi-year meteorological and power production datasets, we have quantified various statistics pertaining to these events and also identified their underlying meteorological drivers. It was found that almost all periods tagged as Dunkelflaute events (with a length of more than 24 h) are in November, December, and January for these countries. On average, there are 50–100 h of such events happening in each of these three months per year. The limited wind and solar power production during Dunkelflaute events is shown to be mainly driven by large-scale high-pressure systems and extensive low-cloud coverage. Even though the possibility of simultaneous Dunkelflaute events in neighboring countries can be as high as 30–40%, such events hardly occur simultaneously in all the eleven countries. Through an interconnected EU-11 power system, the mean frequency of Dunkelflaute drops from 3–9% for the individual countries to approximately 3.5% for the combined region, highlighting the importance of aggregating production over a wide area to better manage the integration of renewable energy generation.","author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Bowen"},{"family":"Basu","given":"Sukanta"},{"family":"Watson","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Russchenberg","given":"Herman"}],"citation-key":"liBriefClimatologyDunkelflaute2021","container-title":"Energies","container-title-short":"Energies","DOI":"10.3390/en14206508","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,11]]},"page":"6508","source":"ResearchGate","title":"A Brief Climatology of Dunkelflaute Events over and Surrounding the North and Baltic Sea Areas","type":"article-journal","volume":"14"},

  {"id":"liSemanticOntologyRepresenting2022","abstract":"Energy flexibility of buildings can be an essential resource for a sustainable and reliable power grid with the growing variable renewable energy shares and the trend to electrify and decarbonize buildings. Traditional demand-side management technologies, advanced building controls, and emerging distributed energy resources (including electric vehicle, energy storage, and on-site power generation) enable the transition of the building stock to grid-interactive efficient buildings (GEBs) that operate efficiently to meet service needs and are responsive to grid pricing or carbon signals to achieve energy and carbon neutrality. Although energy flexibility has received growing attention from industry and the research community, there remains a lack of common ground for energy flexibility terminologies, characterization, and quantification methods. This paper presents a semantic ontology—EFOnt (Energy Flexibility Ontology)—that extends existing terminologies, ontologies, and schemas for building energy flexibility applications. EFOnt aims to serve as a standardized tool for knowledge co-development and streamlining energy flexibility related applications. We demonstrate potential use cases of EFOnt via two examples: (1) energy flexibility analytics with measured data from a residential smart thermostat dataset and a commercial building, and (2) modeling and simulation to evaluate energy flexibility of buildings. The compatibility of EFOnt with existing ontologies and the outlook of EFOnt's role in the building energy data tool ecosystem are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Han"},{"family":"Hong","given":"Tianzhen"}],"citation-key":"liSemanticOntologyRepresenting2022","container-title":"Advances in Applied Energy","container-title-short":"Advances in Applied Energy","DOI":"10.1016/j.adapen.2022.100113","ISSN":"2666-7924","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,1]]},"page":"100113","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"A semantic ontology for representing and quantifying energy flexibility of buildings","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666792422000312","volume":"8"},

The morphologies of anode and cathode at different cycle numbers were also characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The experimental results show that the capacity fading of the batteries become faster at higher rate cycling. The SEM images of the cycled electrodes exhibit that capacity fading of the batteries is possibly attributed to the degradation of the anode structure. When the performance of the battery deteriorates sharply, there is a new semicircular arc appearing in the low-mid frequency region in the relative EIS, indicats that the change of EIS can correlate with the state of the battery performance degradation. Therefore, the performance characteristics of battery can be evaluated according to electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.

  {"id":"loomisIncorporatingDistributionalIssues2011","abstract":"This article reviews the rationale for and various approaches used by economists to incorporate distributional consequences of projects or policies into benefit-cost analyses. Approaches reviewed include distributional weights and metrics based on the Lorenz curve. Analysis of distributional issues in partial equilibrium and general equilibrium settings are briefly reviewed. We present an empirical demonstration of how the contingent valuation method (CVM) and hedonic property methods (HPM) can be used to quantify how non-market environmental benefits are distributed by income and ethnicity. Using CVM, the distribution of non-market benefits can be cross-tabbed with respondent demographics, so that a variety of “distributions” of benefits by relevant demographic groups can be calculated. Using the HPM, the analyst can statistically test to see if the implicit price gradient varies with differences in income and ethnicity. In our empirical example, we find that ethnicity and income interaction terms on the implicit price gradient are statistically significant suggesting differential effects of National Forest fire suppression policies on Hispanics and low income households.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Loomis","given":"John B."}],"citation-key":"loomisIncorporatingDistributionalIssues2011","container-title":"Journal of Benefit-Cost Analysis","DOI":"10.2202/2152-2812.1044","ISSN":"2194-5888, 2152-2812","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",1]]},"language":"en","page":"1-24","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Incorporating Distributional Issues into Benefit Cost Analysis: Why, How, and Two Empirical Examples Using Non-market Valuation","title-short":"Incorporating Distributional Issues into Benefit Cost Analysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-benefit-cost-analysis/article/incorporating-distributional-issues-into-benefit-cost-analysis-why-how-and-two-empirical-examples-using-nonmarket-valuation/E8D2DDACDAE343F55E4C0EF55EB3F84D","volume":"2"},

  {"id":"luoOverviewCurrentDevelopment2015","abstract":"Electrical power generation is changing dramatically across the world because of the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to introduce mixed energy sources. The power network faces great challenges in transmission and distribution to meet demand with unpredictable daily and seasonal variations. Electrical Energy Storage (EES) is recognized as underpinning technologies to have great potential in meeting these challenges, whereby energy is stored in a certain state, according to the technology used, and is converted to electrical energy when needed. However, the wide variety of options and complex characteristic matrices make it difficult to appraise a specific EES technology for a particular application. This paper intends to mitigate this problem by providing a comprehensive and clear picture of the state-of-the-art technologies available, and where they would be suited for integration into a power generation and distribution system. The paper starts with an overview of the operation principles, technical and economic performance features and the current research and development of important EES technologies, sorted into six main categories based on the types of energy stored. Following this, a comprehensive comparison and an application potential analysis of the reviewed technologies are presented.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Luo","given":"Xing"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Jihong"},{"family":"Dooner","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Clarke","given":"Jonathan"}],"citation-key":"luoOverviewCurrentDevelopment2015","container-title":"Applied Energy","container-title-short":"Applied Energy","DOI":"10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.09.081","ISSN":"0306-2619","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"511-536","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Overview of current development in electrical energy storage technologies and the application potential in power system operation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261914010290","volume":"137"},

  {"id":"magdeldinBioSCWGProjectUnderstanding2016","abstract":"This article presents a summary of the main findings from a collaborative research project between Aalto University in Finland and partner universities. A comparative process synthesis, modelling and thermal assessment was conducted for the production of Bio-synthetic natural gas (SNG) and hydrogen from supercritical water refining of a lipid extracted algae feedstock integrated with onsite heat and power generation. The developed reactor models for product gas composition, yield and thermal demand were validated and showed conformity with reported experimental results, and the balance of plant units were designed based on established technologies or state-of-the-art pilot operations. The poly-generative cases illustrated the thermo-chemical constraints and design trade-offs presented by key process parameters such as plant organic throughput, supercritical water refining temperature, nature of desirable coproducts, downstream indirect production and heat recovery scenarios. The evaluated cases favoring hydrogen production at 5 wt. % solid content and 600 °C conversion temperature allowed higher gross syngas and CHP production. However, mainly due to the higher utility demands the net syngas production remained lower compared to the cases favoring BioSNG production. The latter case, at 450 °C reactor temperature, 18 wt. % solid content and presence of downstream indirect production recorded 66.5%, 66.2% and 57.2% energetic, fuel-equivalent and exergetic efficiencies respectively.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Magdeldin","given":"Mohamed"},{"family":"Kohl","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"De Blasio","given":"Cataldo"},{"family":"Järvinen","given":"Mika"},{"family":"Won Park","given":"Song"},{"family":"Giudici","given":"Reinaldo"}],"citation-key":"magdeldinBioSCWGProjectUnderstanding2016","container-title":"Energies","DOI":"10.3390/en9100838","ISSN":"1996-1073","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",10]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"10","page":"838","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"The BioSCWG Project: Understanding the Trade-Offs in the Process and Thermal Design of Hydrogen and Synthetic Natural Gas Production","title-short":"The BioSCWG Project","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/9/10/838","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"matsuoReDefiningSystemLCOE2022","abstract":"The mass introduction of variable renewable energies, including wind and solar photovoltaic, leads to additional costs caused by the intermittency. Many recent studies have addressed these “integration costs,” and proposed novel metrics that replace the traditional metric known as the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). However, the policy relevance of those metrics remains unclear. In this study, the author investigates and re-defines the concept of system LCOE, referring to prior studies, and proposes concrete methods to estimate them. Average system LCOE allocates the integration cost to each power source, dividing that by the adjusted power output. Marginal system LCOE revises the concept of system LCOE and value-adjusted LCOE proposed by prior studies, to be clearer and more policy-relevant. These metrics are also applied to Japan’s power sector in 2050, suggesting the necessity of aiming for a “well-balanced energy mix” in future power systems with decarbonised power sources.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Matsuo","given":"Yuhji"}],"citation-key":"matsuoReDefiningSystemLCOE2022","container-title":"Energies","DOI":"10.3390/en15186845","ISSN":"1996-1073","issue":"18","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"18","page":"6845","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Re-Defining System LCOE: Costs and Values of Power Sources","title-short":"Re-Defining System LCOE","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/18/6845","volume":"15"},

  {"id":"mayyasEconomicsLiionBatteries2022","abstract":"The intermittent nature of power generated by renewable energy systems makes it harder for many power grids to accommodate large generations in short period of times. In this paper, we quantify and discuss the cost associated with storing excess energy from the wholesale electricity markets in the United States in the form of hydrogen using proton exchange membrane reversible fuel cells (PEM-RFC) and in the form of electrochemical energy stored in lithium-ion batteries (LIB). The key financial metric used in this study is the levelized cost of electricity storage (LCOS). Results show that electricity can be stored in many regions in the U.S. at very competitive costs, reaching as low as 16.6¢/kWh using RFC and 8.6¢/kWh using LIB using electricity purchased from California Independent System Operator (CAISO). These values are near the future targets set by the U.S. Department of Energy of 5¢/kWh. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the LCOS using both ESSs is dependent on the following design and financial parameters from higher to lower effect: ESS roundtrip efficiency, system capital cost and the expected system lifetime, respectively. Analysis of system performance and economics showed that LIB seem to have better economic advantage based on the LCOS values, but lack the flexibility of the RFC system. RFC, on the other hand, has more advantages in terms of the size of energy storage capacity, operational charging/discharging flexibility, and the effect on increasing the grid resiliency, especially during long periods of power outages.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Mayyas","given":"Ahmad"},{"family":"Chadly","given":"Assia"},{"family":"Amer","given":"Saed Talib"},{"family":"Azar","given":"Elie"}],"citation-key":"mayyasEconomicsLiionBatteries2022","container-title":"Energy","container-title-short":"Energy","DOI":"10.1016/j.energy.2021.121941","ISSN":"0360-5442","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,15]]},"language":"en","page":"121941","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Economics of the Li-ion batteries and reversible fuel cells as energy storage systems when coupled with dynamic electricity pricing schemes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544221021897","volume":"239"},

Examples of MECE arrangements include categorizing people by year of birth (assuming all years are known), apartments by their building number, letters by postmark, and dice rolls.

  {"id":"messingEstimatingBatteryState2021","abstract":"Among the most important tasks of a Battery Management System (BMS) are State of Charge (SoC) and State of Health (SoH) estimation. Many SoH estimation techniques are available, each with their advantages and drawbacks. These include methods based on a technique known as Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). This technique provides detailed information about the battery's state of health but requires long rest times to prevent the battery relaxation effect from impacting the EIS measurement. In this paper EIS is shown to be able to track the short-term relaxation effect for batteries of different SoH. A SoH estimation method is proposed which combines fractional order impedance modeling and short-term relaxation effects with EIS characterization for rapid SoH determination. This empirical method is demonstrated to have an average SoH estimation error of less than 1%. As new methods arise to simplify EIS hardware requirements for real time applications, the proposed method offers a new way of utilizing EIS for SoH estimation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Messing","given":"Marvin"},{"family":"Shoa","given":"Tina"},{"family":"Habibi","given":"Saeid"}],"citation-key":"messingEstimatingBatteryState2021","container-title":"Journal of Energy Storage","container-title-short":"Journal of Energy Storage","DOI":"10.1016/j.est.2021.103210","ISSN":"2352-152X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"103210","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Estimating battery state of health using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and the relaxation effect","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352152X21009087","volume":"43"},

  {"id":"mianIndebtedDemand2021","abstract":"We propose a theory of indebted demand, capturing the idea that large debt burdens lower aggregate demand, and thus the natural rate of interest. At the core of the theory is the simple yet underappreciated observation that borrowers and savers differ in their marginal propensities to save out of permanent income. Embedding this insight in a two-agent perpetual-youth model, we find that recent trends in income inequality and financial deregulation lead to indebted household demand, pushing down the natural rate of interest. Moreover, popular expansionary policies—such as accommodative monetary policy—generate a debt-financed short-run boom at the expense of indebted demand in the future. When demand is sufficiently indebted, the economy gets stuck in a debt-driven liquidity trap, or debt trap. Escaping a debt trap requires consideration of less conventional macroeconomic policies, such as those focused on redistribution or those reducing the structural sources of high inequality.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Mian","given":"Atif"},{"family":"Straub","given":"Ludwig"},{"family":"Sufi","given":"Amir"}],"citation-key":"mianIndebtedDemand2021","container-title":"The Quarterly Journal of Economics","container-title-short":"The Quarterly Journal of Economics","DOI":"10.1093/qje/qjab007","ISSN":"0033-5533","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,1]]},"page":"2243-2307","source":"Silverchair","title":"Indebted Demand*","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjab007","volume":"136"},

Countries such as Sri Lanka and Bangladesh took the lead to scale up the use of solar home systems in the 90’s providing income generation and social development in rural areas. A new cycle of solar development has taken place over the last 15 years propelled by the use of enabling policy and regulatory instruments, ramping up of solar manufacturing capacity in People’s Republic of China, the scaling up of clean projects through models such as solar parks that took off in India and replicated in other Asian countries including Cambodia. The declining cost of solar power coupled with the mobilization of long tenor concessional public financing (including multilateral support) has helped address key risks and crowd in private capital to the sector. Over time, there is a focus on energy storage for better utilization of solar power as well as offer value added services including for heat and water production, transport sector decarbonization and now green hydrogen. This expands the use case for solar power permitting it to play a more prominent role in meeting energy requirements in the region and particularly in the context of NDC commitments. Policy and regulatory instruments would also need to evolve to help meet these newer and more ambitious deployment plans.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Millison","given":"Dan"},{"family":"George","given":"Len"},{"family":"Acharya","given":"Jiwan"},{"family":"Wijayatunga","given":"Priyantha"}],"citation-key":"millisonEnablingPolicyRegulatory2022","container-title":"Solar Compass","container-title-short":"Solar Compass","DOI":"10.1016/j.solcom.2022.100023","ISSN":"2772-9400","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"100023","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Enabling policy and regulatory environment for solar power development: Lessons in Asia-Pacific region","title-short":"Enabling policy and regulatory environment for solar power development","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772940022000169","volume":"2"},

With this notion, many efforts have been made to find new ways of storing hydrogen. As a result, decades of studies has led to a wide range of hydrides that can store hydrogen in a solid form. Applications of these solid-state hydrides are well-suited to stationary applications. However, the main challenge arises in making the selection of the Metal Hydrides (MH) that are best suited to meet application requirements. Herein, we discuss the current state-of-art in controlling the properties of room temperature (RT) hydrides suitable for stationary application and their long term behavior in addition to initial activation, their limitations and emerging trends to design better storage materials. The hydrogen storage properties and synthesis methods to alter the properties of these MH are discussed including the emerging approach of high-entropy alloys.

  {"id":"MonteCarloMethod2022","abstract":"Monte Carlo methods, or Monte Carlo experiments, are a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. The underlying concept is to use randomness to solve problems that might be deterministic in principle. They are often used in physical and mathematical problems and are most useful when it is difficult or impossible to use other approaches. Monte Carlo methods are mainly used in three problem classes: optimization, numerical integration, and generating draws from a probability distribution.\nIn physics-related problems, Monte Carlo methods are useful for simulating systems with many coupled degrees of freedom, such as fluids, disordered materials, strongly coupled solids, and cellular structures (see cellular Potts model, interacting particle systems, McKean–Vlasov processes, kinetic models of gases).\nOther examples include modeling phenomena with significant uncertainty in inputs such as the calculation of risk in business and, in mathematics, evaluation of multidimensional definite integrals with complicated boundary conditions. In application to systems engineering problems (space, oil exploration, aircraft design, etc.), Monte Carlo–based predictions of failure, cost overruns and schedule overruns are routinely better than human intuition or alternative \"soft\" methods.In principle, Monte Carlo methods can be used to solve any problem having a probabilistic interpretation. By the law of large numbers, integrals described by the expected value of some random variable can be approximated by taking the empirical mean (a.k.a. the 'sample mean') of independent samples of the variable. When the probability distribution of the variable is parameterized, mathematicians often use a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler. The central idea is to design a judicious Markov chain model with a prescribed stationary probability distribution. That is, in the limit, the samples being generated by the MCMC method will be samples from the desired (target) distribution. By the ergodic theorem, the stationary distribution is approximated by the empirical measures of the random states of the MCMC sampler.\nIn other problems, the objective is generating draws from a sequence of probability distributions satisfying a nonlinear evolution equation. These flows of probability distributions can always be interpreted as the distributions of the random states of a Markov process whose transition probabilities depend on the distributions of the current random states (see McKean–Vlasov processes, nonlinear filtering equation). In other instances we are given a flow of probability distributions with an increasing level of sampling complexity (path spaces models with an increasing time horizon, Boltzmann–Gibbs measures associated with decreasing temperature parameters, and many others). These models can also be seen as the evolution of the law of the random states of a nonlinear Markov chain. A natural way to simulate these sophisticated nonlinear Markov processes is to sample multiple copies of the process, replacing in the evolution equation the unknown distributions of the random states by the sampled empirical measures. In contrast with traditional Monte Carlo and MCMC methodologies, these mean-field particle techniques rely on sequential interacting samples. The terminology mean field reflects the fact that each of the samples (a.k.a. particles, individuals, walkers, agents, creatures, or phenotypes) interacts with the empirical measures of the process. When the size of the system tends to infinity, these random empirical measures converge to the deterministic distribution of the random states of the nonlinear Markov chain, so that the statistical interaction between particles vanishes.\nDespite its conceptual and algorithmic simplicity, the computational cost associated with a Monte Carlo simulation can be staggeringly high. In general the method requires many samples to get a good approximation, which may incur an arbitrarily large total runtime if the processing time of a single sample is high. Although this is a severe limitation in very complex problems, the embarrassingly parallel nature of the algorithm allows this large cost to be reduced (perhaps to a feasible level) through parallel computing strategies in local processors, clusters, cloud computing, GPU, FPGA, etc.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,13]]},"citation-key":"MonteCarloMethod2022","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,27]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 1118538557","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Monte Carlo method","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Monte_Carlo_method&oldid=1118538557"},

The investment in renewable technologies for the distributed generation has been creating new opportunities for owners of such technologies. Besides the selling of electricity and related services (ancillary services) in energy markets, players can participate and negotiate in other markets, such as the carbon/CO2 market, the guarantees of origin market, or provide district heating services selling of steam and hot water among others. These market mechanisms are related to the energy market, originating a wide market strategy improving the benefits of using distributed generators. This paper describes several adjacent markets and how do they complement the electricity market. The paper also shows how the simulation of electricity and adjacent markets can be performed, using an electricity market simulator, and demonstrates, based on market simulations using real data from the Iberian market, that the participation in various complementary markets can enable power producers to obtain extra profits that are essential to cover the production costs and facilities maintenance.

The main objective of this work is to facilitate the electrical simulation of lithium-ion battery aging (due to cycling), and its impact on battery capacity and internal resistance. Most of the reported cycle life models are either: a) physics based, with parameters difficult to retrieve or b) semi-empirical, where the parameter identification process requires large amount of experimental data, huge manpower and test duration lasting from months to years. Moreover, these models tend to be valid only for the underlying battery and not for other battery types. This makes the simulation of lithium-ion batteries cycling effects, difficult to achieve, expensive and time consuming. The model proposed in this paper is based on simple physical equations from fatigue theory and equivalent cycle counting. The parameter identification process is straightforward and requires only few data from battery datasheets and limited (or short duration) cycling experiments. The proposed model is generic and able to represent the impact of common cycle life factors such as: depth-of-discharge (DoD), temperature and C-rate.

  {"id":"msheikMethaneCrackingHydrogen2021","abstract":"Currently, hydrogen is mainly generated by steam methane reforming, with signiﬁcant CO2 emissions, thus exacerbating the greenhouse effect. This environmental concern promotes methane cracking, which represents one of the most promising alternatives for hydrogen production with theoretical zero CO/CO2 emissions. Methane cracking has been intensively investigated using metallic and carbonaceous catalysts. Recently, research has focused on methane pyrolysis in molten metals/salts to prevent both reactor coking and rapid catalyst deactivation frequently encountered in conventional pyrolysis. Another expected advantage is the heat transfer improvement due to the high heat capacity of molten media. Apart from the reaction itself that produces hydrogen and solid carbon, the energy source used in this endothermic process can also contribute to reducing environmental impacts. While most researchers used nonrenewable sources based on fossil fuel combustion or electrical heating, concentrated solar energy has not been thoroughly investigated, to date, for pyrolysis in molten media. However, it could be a promising innovative pathway to further improve hydrogen production sustainability from methane cracking. After recalling the basics of conventional catalytic methane cracking and the developed solar cracking reactors, this review delves into the most signiﬁcant results of the state-of-the-art methane pyrolysis in melts (molten metals and salts) to show the advantages and the perspectives of this new path, as well as the carbon products’ characteristics and the main factors governing methane conversion.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Msheik","given":"Malek"},{"family":"Rodat","given":"Sylvain"},{"family":"Abanades","given":"Stéphane"}],"citation-key":"msheikMethaneCrackingHydrogen2021","container-title":"Energies","container-title-short":"Energies","DOI":"10.3390/en14113107","ISSN":"1996-1073","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,26]]},"language":"en","page":"3107","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Methane Cracking for Hydrogen Production: A Review of Catalytic and Molten Media Pyrolysis","title-short":"Methane Cracking for Hydrogen Production","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/14/11/3107","volume":"14"},
  {"id":"muddNickelSulfideLaterite2009","abstract":"There are widespread nickel resources around the world, but divided principally between nickel sulfide or laterite (oxide) resources. Historically production has been dominated by sulfide ores but future production is increasing shifting to laterite ores. The principal reason for this historically is that sulfide ores are easier to process, through conventional mining, smelting and refining, compared to laterite ores which require intensive hydrometallurgical processing (such as high pressure acid leaching or HPAL). This means that laterite ores typically require substantially more energy and chemicals to produce than sulfide nickel. Given that many major nickel companies report annually on their sustainability performance, such as Eramet, Inco (now Vale Inco), WMC Resources (now BHP Billiton), Norilsk Nickel, there is data available to examine in detail the differences in the environmental costs of nickel sulfide versus laterite. The paper compiles and analyses a range of data, showing the higher energy costs of laterite projects, but also the critical importance that energy sources can have on overall environmental costs. Given that the world is continuing to demand nickel, and most uses are somewhat dissipative which limit high rates of recycling, the progressive shift to nickel laterite projects in the global nickel industry is perhaps inevitable, but it will clearly come at higher environmental costs for nickel production. Based on present technology and research, there appears little hope for any alternatives which might significantly reduce the environmental costs of nickel laterite projects. The big sustainability challenges such as energy and greenhouse emissions therefore remain of paramount importance to the nickel sector.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Mudd","given":"Gavin"}],"citation-key":"muddNickelSulfideLaterite2009","container-title":"Canadian Metallurgical Society","container-title-short":"Canadian Metallurgical Society","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",9,1]]},"source":"ResearchGate","title":"Nickel Sulfide Versus Laterite: The Hard Sustainability Challenge Remains","title-short":"Nickel Sulfide Versus Laterite","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228470255_Nickel_Sulfide_Versus_Laterite_The_Hard_Sustainability_Challenge_Remains"},

  {"id":"MujaPowerStation2022","abstract":"Muja Power Station is a power station 22 km (14 mi) east of Collie, Western Australia. It has eight steam turbines served by coal-fired boilers that together generate a total capacity of 854 megawatts of electricity. It is the largest power station in the South West Interconnected System, accounting for roughly 15 percent of capacity. The coal is mined in the nearby Collie Sub-basin. On 14 June 2022 the state government announced that Synergy would close Muja Power Station by 2029.The station was first commissioned on 21 April 1966. Currently four of the eight turbines are running (units 5 through to 8). Muja has four 60 megawatts units (stages A and B), two 200 megawatts units (stage C) and two 227 megawatts units (stage D).According to the National Pollutant Inventory (NPI), Muja Power Station is one of the biggest emitters of air pollution in Australia, including high emissions of beryllium, fluoride and particulate matter. Carbon Monitoring for Action estimates that, in 2009, Muja Power Station emitted 5.75 million tonnes (12.7 billion pounds) of CO2 to generate 5.05 terawatt-hours (18.2 petajoules) of electricity.In household consumer terms, this equates to 1.14 kilograms (2.5 lb) of CO2 emitted for each one kilowatt-hour (kWh), or 3.6 megajoules, of electricity produced and fed into the electricity grid. That is, Muja Power Station emits slightly more CO2 per kilowatt-hour of electricity produced than nearby Collie Power Station (1.13 kilograms or 2.5 pounds) and much more than Bluewaters Power Station (0.825 kilograms or 1.82 pounds) based on estimates for the same year.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,16]]},"citation-key":"MujaPowerStation2022","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,4]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 1108450657","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Muja Power Station","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Muja_Power_Station&oldid=1108450657"},

  {"id":"murphyTaxonomySystemsThat2021","abstract":"Interest in renewable energy-based hybrid systems—which combined multiple renewable energy and/or energy storage technologies—is apparent and growing. Such systems could play an important role in the grid of the future, but our ability to quantify their potential impacts is hindered by (a) the inconsistent treatment of hybrid systems and (b) an incomplete understanding of which aspects of hybridization will have the greatest influence. In this article, we review the literature and propose an organization scheme for utility-scale hybrid systems in which electricity is generated from commercially available, renewable energy technologies, and electricity is the only output. Based on this literature review, we propose three categories for delineating systems that link multiple renewable energy and/or energy storage technologies: co-located resources (locational linkage only), virtual power plants (operational linkage only), and full hybrids (location and operational linkages). Proposing a categorization based on whether the systems involve locational and/or operational linkages reflects the fact that technology combinations do not represent a meaningful delineation. In addition, the categories are ideal for informing model development efforts, by identifying the unique characteristics that must be captured in adequate representations of systems that fall under each category. Our categories can also help inform policy considerations, as they delineate system characteristics that would introduce distinct permitting, siting, interconnection, and policy challenges. Therefore, we believe that our proposed taxonomy will help organize thinking and research efforts in a way that will enable consistent evaluation the costs, values, and potential of renewable energy-based hybrids.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Murphy","given":"C.A."},{"family":"Schleifer","given":"A."},{"family":"Eurek","given":"K."}],"citation-key":"murphyTaxonomySystemsThat2021","container-title":"Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews","container-title-short":"Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews","DOI":"10.1016/j.rser.2021.110711","ISSN":"13640321","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",4]]},"language":"en","page":"110711","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A taxonomy of systems that combine utility-scale renewable energy and energy storage technologies","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1364032121000083","volume":"139"},

  {"id":"mydlandEconomiesScopeScale2020","abstract":"An important issue for multi-product firms to consider is economies of scope, i.e., whether there is any benefit from producing two or more products, or whether specializing in producing only one product would be less costly. We examined the economies of scope for Norwegian electricity companies because policy makers have decided to force companies that both generates and distributes electricity to split their operations into two companies, one engaged in generation only and the other in distribution only. We set out to test the validity of the policy makers decision on unbundling generation and distribution. Using data from Norwegian electricity companies for the period 2004–2014, we found evidence of economies of scope, meaning that policy makers’ insistence on separating generation and distribution companies will have increased costs. We also found evidence of economies of scale, meaning that there are cost savings in expanding outputs. Our findings provide important information to consider in future policy decisions in the Norwegian electricity industry, probably with implications for other countries.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Mydland","given":"Ørjan"},{"family":"Kumbhakar","given":"Subal C."},{"family":"Lien","given":"Gudbrand"},{"family":"Amundsveen","given":"Roar"},{"family":"Kvile","given":"Hilde Marit"}],"citation-key":"mydlandEconomiesScopeScale2020","container-title":"Economic Modelling","container-title-short":"Economic Modelling","DOI":"10.1016/j.econmod.2019.09.008","ISSN":"0264-9993","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"39-46","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Economies of scope and scale in the Norwegian electricity industry","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264999319300495","volume":"88"},
  {"id":"naemiOptimisationAnalysisBattery2022","abstract":"This paper examines the optimal performance of a wind farm and an integrated battery storage system in a wholesale electricity market. Participation in both the energy and Frequency Control Ancillary Services (FCAS) markets and imperfect generation forecasting are all considered. This problem is formulated as an optimisation that maximises the Net Present Value (NPV) of the wind farm and the battery while considering different market conditions and technical constraints. It is found that several, more advanced approaches to the integration and control of wind farm-battery systems can yield significant financial benefits to the asset owner by providing useful system services. These are not solely energy and FCAS services since all the considered approaches can also improve the wind farm’s ability to regulate its own power generation. As such, a battery that is integrated with a wind farm can create greater value than a stand-alone battery of the same size offering the same energy and FCAS services. Furthermore, realisation of these opportunities appears to be consistent with a relatively conventional wholesale market framework.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Naemi","given":"Mostafa"},{"family":"Davis","given":"Dominic"},{"family":"Brear","given":"Michael J."}],"citation-key":"naemiOptimisationAnalysisBattery2022","container-title":"Journal of Cleaner Production","container-title-short":"Journal of Cleaner Production","DOI":"10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.133909","ISSN":"0959-6526","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"133909","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Optimisation and analysis of battery storage integrated into a wind power plant participating in a wholesale electricity market with energy and ancillary services","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652622034795","volume":"373"},

  {"id":"naughtonComprehensiveOptimizationBasedTechnoEconomic2022","abstract":"Hydrogen is being considered as an important option to contribute to energy system decarbonization. However, currently its production from renewables is expensive compared to methods that utilize fossil fuels. This paper proposes a comprehensive optimization-based techno-economic assessment of a hybrid renewable electricity-hydrogen virtual power plant (VPP) that boosts its business case by co-optimizing across multiple markets and contractual services to maximize its profits and eventually deliver hydrogen at a lower net cost. Additionally, multiple possible investment options are considered. Case studies of VPP placement in a renewable-rich, congested area of the Australian network and based on real market data and relevant sensitivities show that multi-market participation can significantly boost the business case for cleaner hydrogen. This highlights the importance of value stacking for driving down the cost of cleaner hydrogen. Due to the participation in multiple markets, all VPP configurations considered are found to be economically viable for a hydrogen price of AUD$3/kg (USD$2.25/kg), which has been identified as a threshold value for Australia to export hydrogen at a competitive price. Additionally, if the high price volatility that has been seen in gas prices in 2022 (and by extension electricity prices) continues, the flexibility of hybrid VPPs will further improve their business cases.","author":[{"family":"Naughton","given":"James"},{"family":"Riaz","given":"Shariq"},{"family":"Cantoni","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xiao-Ping"},{"family":"Mancarella","given":"Pierluigi"}],"citation-key":"naughtonComprehensiveOptimizationBasedTechnoEconomic2022","container-title":"Journal of Modern Power Systems and Clean Energy","DOI":"10.35833/MPCE.2022.000324","ISSN":"2196-5420","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"page":"1-14","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Comprehensive Optimization-Based Techno-Economic Assessment of Hybrid Renewable Electricity-Hydrogen Virtual Power Plants","type":"article-journal"},

We set the context by tracing the evolution of the electric power industry before EPIRA and post-EPIRA. We look at impacts on the consumers in terms of price affordability and supply reliability and impact on production efficiency in terms of system loss reduction. Pre-EPIRA, electricity price in the Philippines was already high relative to other countries. Trends show that, in real terms, there was a price uptrend during the transition (20012005) toward the start of competition in the generation sector. There was a slight downtrend in the real price of electricity after the introduction of spot electricity trading but the price of electricity remains high and it has not declined to pre-EPIRA levels. Supply reliability is still an ongoing concern but the recent past record shows that shortages were managed and did not reach nationwide crisis levels reminiscent of the 1990s. Nevertheless, production efficiency gains were achieved through the reduction of system losses.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Navarro","given":"Adoracion M"},{"family":"Detros","given":"Keith C"}],"citation-key":"navarroPostEPIRAImpactsElectric2016","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Post-EPIRA Impacts of Electric Power Industry Competition Policies","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pidswebs.pids.gov.ph/CDN/PUBLICATIONS/pidsdps1615.pdf"},

  {"id":"nikolakakisAnalysisLongTermVariable2023","abstract":"Following COP26, many countries are embarking on decarbonization strategies for the power sector that may include inter alia storage, hydrogen, and carbon capture (and storage). There is also significant increase in load that may come in the form of electric vehicles (EV) charging and hydrogen requirement for decarbonization of other sectors. While there is a growing literature around long-term decarbonization strategies, there is still ample room for a practical methodology to rigorously test capacity plans to include a range of options inter alia re- optimization of the mix of renewable technologies, better coordination of the (EV) load from a system perspective, or augmenting the plan with battery energy storage (BESS) and hydrogen. This paper presents our research on EV load and green hydrogen modeling including how they can be integrated into long-term electricity models. We also present a methodology that allows planners to undertake a rigorous assessment that can be readily implemented using the World Bank Electricity Planning Model (EPM). The application of the model is illustrated through a case study for Turkey (Türkiye) for 2050. The case study shows how an incumbent policy-driven capacity plan for 2050 that included 33% contribution from variable renewable energy (VRE) may be prone to unserved energy risk during winter months due to seasonal variability of VRE. The analysis goes on to demonstrate how the plan can be reinforced with additional peaking gas turbines, re- optimization of wind and solar, BESS and hydrogen. Coordinated charging of EVs is also shown to bring significant relief to investment requirements.","author":[{"family":"Nikolakakis","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Broekman","given":"Esra Bozkir"},{"family":"Chattopadhyay","given":"Debabrata Mrs"},{"family":"Merino","given":"Almudena Mateos"}],"citation-key":"nikolakakisAnalysisLongTermVariable2023","container-title":"IEEE Access","DOI":"10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3258631","ISSN":"2169-3536","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"page":"27189-27216","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Analysis of Long-Term Variable Renewable Energy Heavy Capacity Plans Including Electric Vehicle and Hydrogen Scenarios: Methodology and Illustrative Case Study for Turkey","title-short":"Analysis of Long-Term Variable Renewable Energy Heavy Capacity Plans Including Electric Vehicle and Hydrogen Scenarios","type":"article-journal","volume":"11"},

  {"id":"nuroldayevaStateHealthEstimation2023","abstract":"Contemporary lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are one of the main components of energy storage systems that need effective management to extend service life and increase reliability and safety. Their characteristics depend highly on internal and external conditions (ageing, temperature, and chemistry). Currently, the state of batteries is determined using two parameters: the state of charge (SOC) and the state of health (SOH). Applying these two parameters makes it possible to calculate the expected battery life and a battery’s performance. There are many methods for estimating the SOH of batteries, including experimental, model-based, and machine learning methods. By comparing model-based estimations with experimental techniques, it can be concluded that the use of experimental methods is not applicable for commercial cases. The electrochemical model-based SOH estimation method clearly explains processes in the battery with the help of multidifferential equations. The machine learning method is based on creating a program trained to predict the battery’s state of health with the help of past ageing data. In this review paper, we analyze the research available in the literature in this direction. It is found that all methods used to assess the SOH of an LIB play an essential role, and each method has its pros and cons.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Nuroldayeva","given":"Gulzat"},{"family":"Serik","given":"Yerkin"},{"family":"Adair","given":"Desmond"},{"family":"Uzakbaiuly","given":"Berik"},{"family":"Bakenov","given":"Zhumabay"}],"citation-key":"nuroldayevaStateHealthEstimation2023","container-title":"International Journal of Energy Research","DOI":"10.1155/2023/4297545","ISSN":"0363-907X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,3]]},"language":"en","page":"e4297545","publisher":"Hindawi","source":"www.hindawi.com","title":"State of Health Estimation Methods for Lithium-Ion Batteries","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijer/2023/4297545/","volume":"2023"},

  {"id":"odukomaiyaAddressingEnergyStorage2021","abstract":"Cost-effective energy storage is a critical enabler for the large-scale deployment of renewable electricity. Significant resources have been directed toward developing cost-effective energy storage, with research and development efforts dominated by work on lithium ion (Li-ion) battery technology. Though Li-ion batteries have many attractive qualities, it is not clear whether they can provide an affordable levelized cost of storage (LCOS) for certain applications, such as buildings. Buildings consume most of the world's electricity, and as much as 50% of their consumption goes toward meeting thermal loads. Thermal energy storage (TES) can provide a cost-effective alternative to Li-ion batteries for buildings; however, two questions remain to be answered. First, how much of total building energy storage requirements can be met via thermal storage for building loads? Second, can the LCOS for TES be favorable compared with Li-ion batteries? In this perspective, using the United States as a case study, we show that the total requirement for TES in buildings is in the range of ∼1200–4500 electrical GW h, depending on the fraction of solar versus wind in the generation mix. Furthermore, we show that with at least 25% wind generation, all of the storage needed by buildings to support the grid can be met by TES. We also introduce a framework to calculate LCOS for on-site TES in buildings to enable a direct comparison with electrical storage technologies such as Li-ion batteries. This is not trivial, because the input energy type for TES (electricity) differs from the output energy type (thermal energy), and the efficiency can depend on ambient conditions.

This could have significant ramifications for Atlantic Ocean heat transport, Arctic sea ice extent and regional North Atlantic climate. However, the potential for far-reaching effects, such as teleconnections to adjacent basins and into the Southern Hemisphere, remains unclear. Here, using a global climate model we show that AMOC collapse can accelerate the Pacific trade winds and Walker circulation by leaving an excess of heat in the tropical South Atlantic. This tropical warming drives anomalous atmospheric convection, resulting in enhanced subsidence over the east Pacific and a strengthened Walker circulation and trade winds. Further teleconnections include weakening of the Indian and South Atlantic subtropical highs and deepening of the Amundsen Sea Low. These findings have important implications for understanding the global climate response to ongoing greenhouse gas increases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Orihuela-Pinto","given":"Bryam"},{"family":"England","given":"Matthew H."},{"family":"Taschetto","given":"Andréa S."}],"citation-key":"orihuela-pintoInterbasinInterhemisphericImpacts2022","container-title":"Nature Climate Change","container-title-short":"Nat.

  {"id":"palmerLifecycleGreenhouseGas2021","abstract":"Water electrolysis powered by solar photovoltaics (PV) is one of several promising green hydrogen production technologies. It is critical that the life cycle environmental impacts and net energy balance are assessed to ensure that solar-electrolysis can contribute to the deep decarbonisation of global energy. Life cycle assessment (LCA) and net energy analysis (NEA) are tools for environmental and net energy assessment of such technologies. LCA/NEA studies of renewable hydrogen typically include simplifying assumptions, such as steady state operation under average conditions. Whilst simplifications may be necessary for preliminary analysis, marked differences arising from context specific variances and operating constraints may be overlooked. To address this gap, we conduct an LCA/NEA of a hypothetical large-scale solar-electrolysis plant, with a focus on operational sensitivities. We find the most significant component is the solar modules due to the materials and processes used in their manufacture. We find the most significant sensitivity stems from the electrolyser turndown and the commensurate need to buffer solar electricity with storage or grid electricity. Under baseline conditions, the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are around one-quarter that of the currently dominant process for hydrogen production, steam methane reforming (SMR). However, sensitivity analysis shows that GHG emissions may be comparable to SMR under reasonably anticipated conditions. Net energy results are less than for fossil fuels and sufficiently uncertain to warrant further attention. We recommend that LCA and NEA are integrated with project planning to ensure that hydrogen meets the goals of green production.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Palmer","given":"Graham"},{"family":"Roberts","given":"Ashley"},{"family":"Hoadley","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Dargaville","given":"Roger"},{"family":"Honnery","given":"Damon"}],"citation-key":"palmerLifecycleGreenhouseGas2021","container-title":"Energy & Environmental Science","container-title-short":"Energy Environ.

  {"id":"patissonHydrogenIronmakingHow2020","abstract":"A new route for making steel from iron ore based on the use of hydrogen to reduce iron oxides is presented, detailed and analyzed. The main advantage of this steelmaking route is the dramatic reduction (90% off) in CO2 emissions compared to those of the current standard blast-furnace route. The first process of the route is the production of hydrogen by water electrolysis using CO2-lean electricity. The challenge is to achieve massive production of H2 in acceptable economic conditions. The second process is the direct reduction of iron ore in a shaft furnace operated with hydrogen only. The third process is the melting of the carbon-free direct reduced iron in an electric arc furnace to produce steel. From mathematical modeling of the direct reduction furnace, we show that complete metallization can be achieved in a reactor smaller than the current shaft furnaces that use syngas made from natural gas. The reduction processes at the scale of the ore pellets are described and modeled using a specific structural kinetic pellet model. Finally, the differences between the reduction by hydrogen and by carbon monoxide are discussed, from the grain scale to the reactor scale. Regarding the kinetics, reduction with hydrogen is definitely faster. Several research and development and innovation projects have very recently been launched that should confirm the viability and performance of this breakthrough and environmentally friendly ironmaking process.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Patisson","given":"Fabrice"},{"family":"Mirgaux","given":"Olivier"}],"citation-key":"patissonHydrogenIronmakingHow2020","container-title":"Metals","DOI":"10.3390/met10070922","ISSN":"2075-4701","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",7]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"7","page":"922","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Hydrogen Ironmaking: How It Works","title-short":"Hydrogen Ironmaking","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/10/7/922","volume":"10"},
  {"id":"patrickbeanLeastRiskPlanningElectric2013","abstract":"In an environment of significant uncertainty about fuel prices, environmental regulations, and energy demand growth, traditional utility planning leads to investment decisions that create considerable risks, according to a report co-authored by the Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions. The paper describes how a minimax regret analysis could supplement current planning techniques, which typically weigh cost. By considering risk across a broad range of scenarios facing the industry, minimax regret analysis may help utilities better avoid decisions that reduce their flexibility to respond to changing market conditions. As a result, utilities can avoid regrettable investment decisions and negative effects for ratepayers while better measuring diversity in their portfolio—ensuring no one energy resource is relied on too heavily.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Patrick Bean","given":"David Hoppock"}],"citation-key":"patrickbeanLeastRiskPlanningElectric2013","container-title":"Nicholas Institute","genre":"Text","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",9,3]]},"language":"en","note":"Last Modified: 2018-07-13T14:10-04:00","publisher":"Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions, Duke University","title":"Least-Risk Planning for Electric Utilities","type":"webpage","URL":"https://nicholasinstitute.duke.edu/publications/least-risk-planning-electric-utilities"},

  {"id":"pavicEnergyReserveCooptimisation2019","abstract":"Ancillary services used for active power balancing are called balancing services or operating reserves and their provision is vital for maintaining power system frequency at the nominal value. In a deregulated environment, where generation is unbundled from transmission and distribution operations, independently owned generating companies may elect to provide operating reserves. However, it is not easy to calculate the exact cost of reserve provision and, therefore, bid for it accurately. Although the cost efficiency of reserve provision can be improved by co-optimising energy and reserve markets, generating companies can still encounter monetary losses caused by the provision of reserve. Currently, these losses are compensated based on ex-post calculations. Hence, current energy and reserve prices do not adequately factor in the ex-post compensation caused by reserve provision. This study proposes an energy and reserve co-optimisation with an explicit consideration of two compensation mechanisms, i.e. lost opportunity and uplift payments. The problem is structured as a bilevel model. The upper level is a mixed-integer unit commitment problem and the lower level is a continuous economic dispatch problem. The case study shows that the proposed model increases market efficiency.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Pavić","given":"Ivan"},{"family":"Dvorkin","given":"Yury"},{"family":"Pandžić","given":"Hrvoje"}],"citation-key":"pavicEnergyReserveCooptimisation2019","container-title":"IET Generation, Transmission & Distribution","DOI":"10.1049/iet-gtd.2018.5480","ISSN":"1751-8695","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","page":"229-237","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Energy and reserve co-optimisation – reserve availability, lost opportunity and uplift compensation cost","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1049/iet-gtd.2018.5480","volume":"13"},

Scope of this paper is to present a techno-economic assessment methodology to evaluate the viability of net-metering policy in medium-voltage prosumers. Unlike most relevant methods, the proposed methodology combines techno-economic analysis with a quasi-static simulation model incorporating the real-world operational properties of the distribution network, where the medium-voltage prosumers are connected. The analysis focuses on nine university campuses operating under net-metering policy.

  {"id":"prakashReviewBatteryEnergy2022","abstract":"Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) are essential for increasing distribution network performance. Appropriate location, size, and operation of BESS can improve overall network performance. The appropriately scaled and installed BESS helps meet peak energy demand, improve the advantages of integrating renewable and distributed energy sources, improve power quality control, and lower the cost of expanding or re-configuring the distribution networks. This paper investigates the feasibility of BESS for providing short-term and long-term ancillary services in power distribution grids by reviewing the developments and limitations in the last decade (2010–2022). The short-term ancillary services are reviewed for voltage support, frequency regulation, and black start. The long-term ancillary services are reviewed for peak shaving, congestion relief, and power smoothing. Reviewing short-term ancillary services provides renewable energy operators and researchers with a vast range of recent BESS-based methodologies for fast response services to distribution grids. Long-term ancillary services will provide the distributed network system operators and researchers with current BESS-based bulk-energy methods to improve network reliability and power quality and maximize revenue from renewable energy generation. The review presents a list of energy storage policies and BESS projects worldwide with a cost-benefit analysis. The challenges for deploying BESS in distribution grids recommended solutions for the implementation challenges, and future research directions are also presented.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Prakash","given":"Krishneel"},{"family":"Ali","given":"Muhammad"},{"family":"Siddique","given":"Md Nazrul Islam"},{"family":"Chand","given":"Aneesh A."},{"family":"Kumar","given":"Nallapaneni Manoj"},{"family":"Dong","given":"Daoyi"},{"family":"Pota","given":"Hemanshu R."}],"citation-key":"prakashReviewBatteryEnergy2022","container-title":"Frontiers in Energy Research","ISSN":"2296-598X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"source":"Frontiers","title":"A review of battery energy storage systems for ancillary services in distribution grids: Current status, challenges and future directions","title-short":"A review of battery energy storage systems for ancillary services in distribution grids","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenrg.2022.971704","volume":"10"},
  {"id":"pratamaScreeningCurveValuing2021","abstract":"The 21st century grids are characterised by increasing complexity of the system: high intermittent renewable energy sources (iRES) penetration requires additional flexibility and ancillary services from the other technologies (for example inertia, frequency responses, etc.). Accordingly, evaluating power technologies, i.e., power generation and storage, with LCOE, that exclusively emphasises the value of energy, alone can be misleading. On the other hand, performing detailed modeling analysis requires an enormous amount of effort and data which may not be accessible. To fill this gap, this study proposes a new metric to evaluate the performance of power technologies in the system. In addition to energy, a range of ancillary services is also considered. To balance completeness and ease of use, only the most valuable services are included in the new concept. To quantify the value of those services, we employed the Electricity System Optimisation framework with ancillary services (ESO-ANCIL) using UK electricity system as the case. Our analysis shows that although all services are valuable, capacity and energy services are the most significant. Whilst the technology screening curve is a practical approach to value those services and to derive optimal technology mix based on the system’s load duration curve, such method cannot evaluate iRES and electricity storage in the system. Therefore, we introduced a new set of rules and formulations to allow the application of the analysis for those technologies. As such, the proposed concept is particularly valuable to estimate the optimal deployment level and role or power technologies in providing energy and capacity services to the grid. Our proposed concept proves to be an easy-to-use concept that is capable in valuing a more complete set of services offered by power generation and storage technologies and can be used as an alternative to the LCOE.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Pratama","given":"Yoga W."},{"family":"Mac Dowell","given":"Niall"}],"citation-key":"pratamaScreeningCurveValuing2021","DOI":"10.2139/ssrn.3821841","event-place":"Rochester, NY","genre":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,7]]},"language":"en","number":"3821841","publisher-place":"Rochester, NY","source":"Social Science Research Network","title":"Screening Curve for Valuing Power Generation and Storage Technologies in the 21st Century Grid","type":"article","URL":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3821841"},

  {"id":"pregerDegradationCommercialLithiumIon2020","abstract":"Energy storage systems with Li-ion batteries are increasingly deployed to maintain a robust and resilient grid and facilitate the integration of renewable energy resources. However, appropriate selection of cells for different applications is difficult due to limited public data comparing the most commonly used off-the-shelf Li-ion chemistries under the same operating conditions. This article details a multi-year cycling study of commercial LiFePO4 (LFP), LiNixCoyAl1−x−yO2 (NCA), and LiNixMnyCo1−x−yO2 (NMC) cells, varying the discharge rate, depth of discharge (DOD), and environment temperature. The capacity and discharge energy retention, as well as the round-trip efficiency, were compared. Even when operated within manufacturer specifications, the range of cycling conditions had a profound effect on cell degradation, with time to reach 80% capacity varying by thousands of hours and cycle counts among cells of each chemistry. The degradation of cells in this study was compared to that of similar cells in previous studies to identify universal trends and to provide a standard deviation for performance. All cycling files have been made publicly available at batteryarchive.org, a recently developed repository for visualization and comparison of battery data, to facilitate future experimental and modeling efforts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Preger","given":"Yuliya"},{"family":"Barkholtz","given":"Heather M."},{"family":"Fresquez","given":"Armando"},{"family":"Campbell","given":"Daniel L."},{"family":"Juba","given":"Benjamin W."},{"family":"Romàn-Kustas","given":"Jessica"},{"family":"Ferreira","given":"Summer R."},{"family":"Chalamala","given":"Babu"}],"citation-key":"pregerDegradationCommercialLithiumIon2020","container-title":"Journal of The Electrochemical Society","container-title-short":"J.

  {"id":"qiuPricingModelReactive2022","abstract":"Driven by the gradual increase of the renewable energy installed capacity, shared energy storage (SES) has the potential to play an important role in the renewable energy accommodation scenario. In the process of accommodating renewable energy, SES users can also provide reactive power services to earn revenue and further improve the utilization rate of energy storage resources. In this context, a pricing model of reactive power services of SES is proposed in this paper to make SES users obtain reasonable revenue from the provided reactive power response capability. Firstly, based on the analysis of the cost composition, capacity constraint and application value of reactive power services, a cost-based time-variant capacity price is designed considering the investment cost and the opportunity cost of SES users. Moreover, the baseline power for renewable energy accommodation is proposed to quantify the opportunity cost caused by reactive power services in the renewable energy accommodation scenario. Finally, a case study based on the actual data of an SES trading pilot project in Qinghai, China, shows that the proposed pricing model can effectively reflect the costs of reactive power services which are highly coupled to the active power for renewable energy accommodation, and make SES users obtain the reasonable revenue covering the costs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Qiu","given":"Weiqiang"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Changming"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Zhi"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yiting"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Lianfang"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Zhenzhi"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Li"}],"citation-key":"qiuPricingModelReactive2022","collection-title":"2022 The 5th International Conference on Renewable Energy and Environment Engineering","container-title":"Energy Reports","container-title-short":"Energy Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.egyr.2022.10.094","ISSN":"2352-4847","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"427-436","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Pricing model of reactive power services of shared energy storage considering baseline power for renewable energy accommodation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352484722020303","volume":"8"},

However, three key issues emerged from the mid-2000s: (i) a significant and largely unnecessary rise in network expenditures; (ii) emissions policy discontinuity; and (iii) a large increase in wholesale prices due to rising fuel prices and the sudden exit of generators. The consequence was a doubling in retail prices. Deficiencies in cost-recovery mechanisms have meant price increases have disproportionately affected low-income households.

  {"id":"ramanathanAvoidingDangerousAnthropogenic2008","abstract":"The observed increase in the concentration of greenhouse gases (GHGs) since the preindustrial era has most likely committed the world to a warming of 2.4°C (1.4°C to 4.3°C) above the preindustrial surface temperatures. The committed warming is inferred from the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates of the greenhouse forcing and climate sensitivity. The estimated warming of 2.4°C is the equilibrium warming above preindustrial temperatures that the world will observe even if GHG concentrations are held fixed at their 2005 concentration levels but without any other anthropogenic forcing such as the cooling effect of aerosols. The range of 1.4°C to 4.3°C in the committed warming overlaps and surpasses the currently perceived threshold range of 1°C to 3°C for dangerous anthropogenic interference with many of the climate-tipping elements such as the summer arctic sea ice, Himalayan–Tibetan glaciers, and the Greenland Ice Sheet. IPCC models suggest that ≈25% (0.6°C) of the committed warming has been realized as of now. About 90% or more of the rest of the committed warming of 1.6°C will unfold during the 21st century, determined by the rate of the unmasking of the aerosol cooling effect by air pollution abatement laws and by the rate of release of the GHGs-forcing stored in the oceans. The accompanying sea-level rise can continue for more than several centuries. Lastly, even the most aggressive CO2 mitigation steps as envisioned now can only limit further additions to the committed warming, but not reduce the already committed GHGs warming of 2.4°C.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Ramanathan","given":"V."},{"family":"Feng","given":"Y."}],"citation-key":"ramanathanAvoidingDangerousAnthropogenic2008","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.0803838105","issue":"38","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",9,23]]},"page":"14245-14250","publisher":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","source":"pnas.org (Atypon)","title":"On avoiding dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system: Formidable challenges ahead","title-short":"On avoiding dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0803838105","volume":"105"},

Quick ancillary services provided by battery energy storage systems (BESS) could be a resource in order to deliver fast and precise response to frequency events. Degrees of freedom in the design of innovative products traded on ancillary services markets give the asset manager room for developing state-of-charge (SoC) restoration mechanisms. These are necessary to effectively exploit BESS as key resources for electricity balancing. This study compares the main SoC restoration strategies. It aims to define which ones are suitable for guaranteeing the reliability of the provision and the return on the investment. A robust regulatory framework analysis describes the degrees of freedom guaranteed by the main experiences around Europe. In this paper, a BESS model with variable efficiency is used to compare the provision of Frequency Containment Reserve (FCR) with different SoC restoration strategies exploiting one or more degrees of freedom. Here, we show that the degrees of freedom are key to the reliability of provision. Among most diffused mechanisms, dead-band strategies secure the desired consistency, but require large energy flows for SoC management. Thus, BESS life and economics decrease.

  {"id":"RegimeShift2022","abstract":"Regime shifts are large, abrupt, persistent changes in the structure and function of ecosystems, the climate, financial systems or other complex systems. A regime is a characteristic behaviour of a system which is maintained by mutually reinforced processes or feedbacks. Regimes are considered persistent relative to the time period over which the shift occurs. The change of regimes, or the shift, usually occurs when a smooth change in an internal process (feedback) or a single disturbance (external shocks) triggers a completely different system behavior. Although such non-linear changes have been widely studied in different disciplines ranging from atoms to climate dynamics, regime shifts have gained importance in ecology because they can substantially affect the flow of ecosystem services that societies rely upon, such as provision of food, clean water or climate regulation. Moreover, regime shift occurrence is expected to increase as human influence on the planet increases – the Anthropocene – including current trends on human induced climate change and biodiversity loss. When regime shifts are associated with a critical or bifurcation point, they may also be referred to as critical transitions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,15]]},"citation-key":"RegimeShift2022","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,31]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 1107698603","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Regime shift","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Regime_shift&oldid=1107698603"},

  {"id":"rekstenProjectingFutureCost2022","abstract":"The investment costs of water electrolysis represent one key challenge for the realisation of renewable hydrogen-based energy systems. This work presents a technology cost assessment and outlook towards 2030 for alkaline electrolysers (AEL) and PEM electrolysers (PEMEL) in the MW to GW range taking into consideration the effects of plant size and expected technology developments. Critical selected data was fitted to a modified power law to describe the cost of an electrolyser plant based on the overall capacity and a learning/technology development rate to derive cost estimations for different PEMEL and AEL plant capacities towards 2030. The analysis predicts that the CAPEX gap between AEL and PEMEL technologies will decrease significantly towards 2030 with plant size until 1–10 MW range. Beyond this, only marginal cost reductions can be expected with CAPEX values approaching 320–400 $/kW for large scale (greater than 100 MW) plants by 2030 with subsequent cost reductions possible. Learning rates for electrolysers were estimated at 25–30% for both AEL and PEMEL, which are significantly higher than the learning rates reported in previous literature.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Reksten","given":"Anita H."},{"family":"Thomassen","given":"Magnus S."},{"family":"Møller-Holst","given":"Steffen"},{"family":"Sundseth","given":"Kyrre"}],"citation-key":"rekstenProjectingFutureCost2022","container-title":"International Journal of Hydrogen Energy","container-title-short":"International Journal of Hydrogen Energy","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.08.306","ISSN":"0360-3199","issue":"90","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,9]]},"language":"en","page":"38106-38113","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Projecting the future cost of PEM and alkaline water electrolysers; a CAPEX model including electrolyser plant size and technology development","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360319922040253","volume":"47"},

  {"id":"revinovaForecastingDevelopmentGreen2023","abstract":"Hydrogen energy is expected to become one of the most efficient ways to decarbonize global energy and transportation systems. Green hydrogen production costs are currently high but are likely to decline due to the economy of scale and learning-by-doing effects. The purpose of this paper is to forecast future green hydrogen costs based on the multicomponent learning curves approach. The study investigates the learning curves for the main components in hydrogen value chains: electrolyzers and renewable energy. Our findings estimate the learning rates in the production of PEM and AE electrolyzers as 4%, which is quite conservative compared to other studies. The estimations of learning rates in renewable energy electricity generation range from 14.28 to 14.44% for solar-based and 7.35 to 9.63% for wind-based production. The estimation of the learning rate in green hydrogen production ranges from 4% to 10.2% due to uncertainty in data about the cost structure. The study finds that government support is needed to accelerate electrolysis technology development and achieve decarbonization goals by 2050.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Revinova","given":"Svetlana"},{"family":"Lazanyuk","given":"Inna"},{"family":"Ratner","given":"Svetlana"},{"family":"Gomonov","given":"Konstantin"}],"citation-key":"revinovaForecastingDevelopmentGreen2023","container-title":"Energies","DOI":"10.3390/en16114338","ISSN":"1996-1073","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"11","page":"4338","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Forecasting Development of Green Hydrogen Production Technologies Using Component-Based Learning Curves","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/16/11/4338","volume":"16"},

  {"id":"riayatsyahTechnoEconomicAnalysisOptimisation2022","abstract":"This study aimed to conduct a techno-economic performance and optimisation analysis of grid-connected PV, wind turbines, and battery packs for Syiah Kuala University, situated at the tip of Sumatra island in the tsunami-affected region. The simulation software Hybrid Optimisation Model for Electric Renewables (HOMER) was used to analyse and optimise the renewable energy required by the institution. The methodology began with the location specification, average electric load demand, daily radiation, clearness index, location daily temperature, and system architecture. The results revealed that the energy storage system was initially included in the simulation, but it was later removed in order to save money and optimise the share of renewable energy. Based on the optimisation results, two types of energy sources were chosen for the system, solar PV and wind turbine, which contributed 62% and 20%, respectively. Apart from the renewable energy faction, another reason for the system selection is cost of energy (CoE), which decreased to $0.0446/kWh from$0.060/kWh. In conclusion, the study found that by connecting solar PV and wind turbines to the local grid, this renewable energy system is able to contribute up to 82% of the electricity required. However, the obstacle to implementing renewable energy in Indonesia is the cheap electricity price that is mainly generated using cheap coal, which is abundantly available in the country.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Riayatsyah","given":"T.

  {"id":"rudnickLearningDevelopingCountry2019","abstract":"The Colombian power market was established in 1995, driven primarily by concerns about the reliability of supply in the largely hydro-based domestic power system. The power sector reform was expected to help avoid blackouts by attracting private investment and increasing the efficiency of existing capacity. However, two decades after its inception, the market has not been successful in providing reliable supply along competitive outcomes. This paper analyzes the experience of Colombia with power markets, including market design, implementation, and outcomes. A single-node, bid-based market was established overnight, with bilateral contracts among market participants (mostly short-to-medium term). The original regulated capacity payment was replaced in 2004 by a reliability market intended to ensure supply during tight hydrological conditions (mainly due to El Nino phenomena). However, the Colombian power sector is currently showing signs of structural weakness: the reliability market has shown dysfunctionalities, the government has intervened the market during critical situations, and concerns persist regarding market power exercise. The experience of Colombia is important for other developing countries, since it highlights the challenges of designing and implementing a power market that successfully provides reliability, competitive outcomes, and sustainability. Although key local hydrological conditions were considered in the design of Colombia's capacity market, the market had difficulties delivering intended outcomes due to design and institutional issues, particularly the lack of a comprehensive approach to gas supply and transport.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Rudnick","given":"Hugh"},{"family":"Velasquez","given":"Constantin"}],"citation-key":"rudnickLearningDevelopingCountry2019","DOI":"10.1596/1813-9450-8771","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",3]]},"publisher":"World Bank, Washington, DC","source":"openknowledge.worldbank.org","title":"Learning from Developing Country Power Market Experiences","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://hdl.handle.net/10986/31397"},

A multi-phase, multi-sited and mixed methods design was utilized, in which, Phase 1 included collecting semi-structured interviews and focus group data, and Phase 2 consisted of six patient/caregiver dyad prospective case studies. This study was conducted in three hospitals in three cities in a single province in Canada. The Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM) was employed to model daily operations of the transition process. The perspectives of both healthcare providers and patients/caregivers were used to build the FRAM model. The transition model was then tested using a customized version of the FRAM. The six patient/caregiver cases were used in the process of testing the FRAM model. The results of building the FRAM model showed that five categories of functions contributed to the transition model, including admission, assessment, synthesis, decision-making, and readmission. The outcomes of using the customized version of the FRAM revealed challenges affecting the transition process including waitlists for geriatric units, team-based care, lack of a discharge planner, financial concerns, and follow-up plans. The findings of this study could assist managers and other decision makers to improve the transition processes of frail older adults by addressing these challenges. The FRAM method employed in this study can be applied widely to identify work practices that are more or less successful, so that procedures and practices can be adapted to nudge healthcare processes towards paths that will yield better outcomes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Salehi","given":"Vahid"},{"family":"Hanson","given":"Natasha"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Doug"},{"family":"McCloskey","given":"Rose"},{"family":"Jarrett","given":"Pamela"},{"family":"Veitch","given":"Brian"}],"citation-key":"salehiModelingAnalyzingHospital2021","container-title":"Applied Ergonomics","container-title-short":"Applied Ergonomics","DOI":"10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103392","ISSN":"0003-6870","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"103392","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Modeling and analyzing hospital to home transition processes of frail older adults using the functional resonance analysis method (FRAM)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021000399","volume":"93"},

The present paper proposes a novel approach for the development of software tools to solve auction-based local electricity markets, considering the special needs of local energy communities. The proposed approach considers constrained bids that can increase the effectiveness of distributed generation use. The proposed method takes advantage of semantic web technologies, in order to provide models with the required dynamism to overcome the issues related to the constant changes in data and business models. Using such techniques allows the system to be agnostic to the data model and business rules.

Several modelling tools directed to the study of restructured wholesale electricity markets have emerged.

  {"id":"sapkotaAnalysisPricesettingGeneration2022","abstract":"Being the most competitive energy source in terms of the levelized cost of electricity, and supported by government policies to reduce carbon emissions, variable renewable energy (VRE) penetration is increasing globally, including in the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM). This research tries to analyse the impact of this change on price-setting technologies in the NEM. The main objective of the research is to broaden the knowledge on price-setting dynamics across different Australian regional electricity markets and to provide a full picture of which technologies set market prices during different scenarios. By analysing the 5-minute dispatch period data from 2009-2021 we found that price-setting in the NEM is typically dominated by black coal generators. Hydropower, gas, and brown coal generators also set electricity prices for significant periods, however, contribution of renewable generators (solar, wind) to price-setting is still almost negligible. By conducting a 90-day rolling window analysis we found that the share of black coal to set electricity prices is decreasing, while the share of renewable has been increasing through time. We found that black coal generators are more likely to set electricity prices during off-peak periods, while gas and hydropower generators set electricity prices more frequently during peak periods. Among the renewable generators, solar is more active to set electricity prices in the middle of the day when sunlight is abundant, while wind generators set electricity prices more frequently in the early morning and at midday. Coal generators contributed most to electricity prices during periods of lower demand levels, while at the highest demand quantile, coal, gas, and hydropower generators are more likely to set electricity prices. Peak load generators such as gas and hydropower were also setting negative electricity prices. The start-up cost of those generators is lower, and the ramp-up rate is higher so, setting negative electricity prices by those peak load plants was an anomaly. Our research found some evidence that this anomaly may have resulted from strategic behaviour of these generators. Our logistic regression confirms most of the findings of our factor analysis. In addition, it shows that black and brown coal generators are more likely to set electricity prices in summer, while hydropower and gas generators are more likely to set electricity prices in winter. During the carbon tax period, the probability of renewable generators to set electricity prices was increased, while that of fossil fuel-based generators was decreased. Similarly, over time, black coal is less likely to set any extreme electricity prices, while wind and gas generators have become more likely to set prices during spike periods. At the same time VRE technologies also have a higher probability to set negative prices.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Sapkota","given":"Santosh"}],"citation-key":"sapkotaAnalysisPricesettingGeneration2022","DOI":"10.25949/21599085.v1","genre":"thesis","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,22]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Macquarie University","source":"figshare.mq.edu.au","title":"An analysis of price-setting generation technologies in the Australian National Electricity Market","type":"thesis","URL":"https://figshare.mq.edu.au/articles/thesis/An_analysis_of_price-setting_generation_technologies_in_the_Australian_National_Electricity_Market/21599085/1"},

  {"id":"sarhanImpactTechnoeconomicParameters2021","abstract":"The design and operation of cost-effective power systems and high penetration of renewable energy and energy storage require a modeling approach that simultaneously reflects the system's reality. Although power systems with high penetration of renewable energy and energy storage have been analyzed in the past, more systematic analysis are in need to determine the impact of generation units' techno-economic parameters on the model's accuracy. This study investigated the effects of the techno-economic and spatial-temporal parameters, which will be referred to as combined techno-economic parameters, via seven scenarios. The combined techno-economic effects were demonstrated on optimal generation mix, renewable curtailments, variability status of storage units, and energy cost. The omission of combined techno-economic parameters results in the renewable generation to be more visible and with less curtailment while significantly decreasing the share of energy storage and decreasing the energy cost by 1.53 USD/MWh. As a result, if power systems assessment dismissed the evolving techno-economic and spatial–temporal parameters, the precision of cost–benefit analysis can be compromised, thus affecting the decision-making in terms of directing projects, regulations, and policies within the power industry.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Sarhan","given":"Ameen"},{"family":"Ramachandaramurthy","given":"Vigna K."},{"family":"Kiong","given":"Tiong Seih"},{"family":"Ekanayake","given":"Janaka"}],"citation-key":"sarhanImpactTechnoeconomicParameters2021","container-title":"International Transactions on Electrical Energy Systems","DOI":"10.1002/2050-7038.13073","ISSN":"2050-7038","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","page":"e13073","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Impact of techno-economic parameters on the power systems model with high share of renewable energy and energy storage","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2050-7038.13073","volume":"31"},

  {"id":"schollHowMarketEcology2021","abstract":"Standard approaches to the theory of financial markets are based on equilibrium and efficiency. Here we develop an alternative based on concepts and methods developed by biologists, in which the wealth invested in a financial strategy is like the abundance of a species. We study a toy model of a market consisting of value investors, trend followers, and noise traders. We show that the average returns of strategies are strongly density dependent; that is, they depend on the wealth invested in each strategy at any given time. In the absence of noise, the market would slowly evolve toward an efficient equilibrium, but the statistical uncertainty in profitability (which is calibrated to match real markets) makes this noisy and uncertain. Even in the long term, the market spends extended periods of time away from perfect efficiency. We show how core concepts from ecology, such as the community matrix and food webs, give insight into market behavior. For example, at the efficient equilibrium, all three strategies have a mutualistic relationship, meaning that an increase in the wealth of one increases the returns of the others. The wealth dynamics of the market ecosystem explain how market inefficiencies spontaneously occur and gives insight into the origins of excess price volatility and deviations of prices from fundamental values.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Scholl","given":"Maarten P."},{"family":"Calinescu","given":"Anisoara"},{"family":"Farmer","given":"J.

  {"id":"SemanticWeb2023","abstract":"The Semantic Web, sometimes known as Web 3.0 (not to be confused with Web3), is an extension of the World Wide Web through standards set by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The goal of the Semantic Web is to make Internet data machine-readable.\nTo enable the encoding of semantics with the data, technologies such as Resource Description Framework (RDF) and Web Ontology Language (OWL) are used. These technologies are used to formally represent metadata. For example, ontology can describe concepts, relationships between entities, and categories of things. These embedded semantics offer significant advantages such as reasoning over data and operating with heterogeneous data sources.These standards promote common data formats and exchange protocols on the Web, fundamentally the RDF. According to the W3C, \"The Semantic Web provides a common framework that allows data to be shared and reused across application, enterprise, and community boundaries.\" The Semantic Web is therefore regarded as an integrator across different content and information applications and systems.\nThe term was coined by Tim Berners-Lee for a web of data (or data web) that can be processed by machines—that is, one in which much of the meaning is machine-readable. While its critics have questioned its feasibility, proponents argue that applications in library and information science, industry, biology and human sciences research have already proven the validity of the original concept.Berners-Lee originally expressed his vision of the Semantic Web in 1999 as follows:\n\nI have a dream for the Web [in which computers] become capable of analyzing all the data on the Web – the content, links, and transactions between people and computers. A \"Semantic Web\", which makes this possible, has yet to emerge, but when it does, the day-to-day mechanisms of trade, bureaucracy and our daily lives will be handled by machines talking to machines. The \"intelligent agents\" people have touted for ages will finally materialize.\nThe 2001 Scientific American article by Berners-Lee, Hendler, and Lassila described an expected evolution of the existing Web to a Semantic Web. In 2006, Berners-Lee and colleagues stated that: \"This simple idea…remains largely unrealized\".\nIn 2013, more than four million Web domains (out of roughly 250 million total) contained Semantic Web markup.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,25]]},"citation-key":"SemanticWeb2023","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,12]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 1189520403","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Semantic Web","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Semantic_Web&oldid=1189520403"},

  {"id":"simshauserStaticVsDynamic2024","abstract":"Scaling-up Variable Renewable Energy will face critical bottlenecks vis-a-vis requisite transmission hosting capacity. Network developments must navigate the complexity of encroaching on private land, risk disturbing sites of cultural significance, compete with other environmental (i.e. biodiversity) objectives, and endure backlash from directly affected communities. Transmission is costly and post-pandemic supply-chain constraints are sending equipment costs higher. Given time and cost risks, existing transmission networks and successful augmentations need to function at their outer operating envelope. In this article, a Renewable Energy Zone (REZ) is examined by comparing static, seaonal and real-time dynamic line ratings. Historically, seasonal line ratings in the Queensland region of Australia's National Electricity Market reflected the still, hot conditions that characterised critical event maximum demand days. Widespread take-up rates of rooftop solar PV has shifted maximum (grid-supplied) demand to the late-afternoon when wind speeds are rising, which also provides thermal cooling to transmission lines. Optimisation modelling suggests a shift from static to dynamic line ratings for a reference 275 kV radial REZ in Queensland can increase wind hosting capacity from ∼1700 MW to >2800 MW with limited change in the asset base. Dynamically adjusting Frequency Control Ancillary Services further increases VRE hosting capacity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Simshauser","given":"Paul"}],"citation-key":"simshauserStaticVsDynamic2024","container-title":"Energy Economics","container-title-short":"Energy Economics","DOI":"10.1016/j.eneco.2023.107233","ISSN":"0140-9883","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,1]]},"page":"107233","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"On static vs. dynamic line ratings in renewable energy zones","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988323007314","volume":"129"},

Development and utilization of clean and renewable energy is a significant measure to contribute for the carbon neutrality. Geothermal resource is an important clean and renewable energy, because of its advantages of abundant reserves, exploitation without restrictions from the climate and season. Extracting heat from the high temperature geothermal reservoir requires well drilling, completion and fracturing. However, due to some particular conditions in geothermal development, such as high temperature, erosion, leakage, and hard rocks, traditional petroleum well drilling and completion technologies are not well applicable in the geothermal industry. In this paper, the state-of-the-art geothermal drilling, and completion technologies as well as several fracturing methods, such as foam drilling, air hammer drilling, hydrothermal jet drilling, expansion casing technology, high temperature resistant drilling fluid and cement, chemical stimulation and thermal stimulation are comprehensively reviewed. Besides, heat extraction performances of water and CO2 as working fluids in the geothermal system are discussed. A few novel heat extraction methods including closed loop, open loop, enhanced geothermal systems are compared and analyzed.

However, such profiles may differ from the actual operation of batteries in electric vehicles and stationary applications, where they are subjected to different partial charges and discharges. These partial cycles, which take place during a main charge or discharge process, are called micro-cycles if their depth of discharge is <2 %. A number of authors have pointed out the relevance of the time resolution to estimate the energy throughput of a battery due to these micro-cycles in applications such as renewable microgrids. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no experimental studies in the literature that assess the impact of these micro-cycles on battery degradation. In this article, the impact of micro-cycles on the loss of performance of a lithium-ion battery is experimentally studied. The results show that micro-cycles have a negligible, or even positive effect on the aging of lithium-ion cells compared to the aging caused by full cycles. In fact, if charge throughput or equivalent full cycles are used to measure the use of a battery, then cells subjected to micro-cycles exhibit a 50 % extended lifetime compared to cells only subjected to full cycles. More precisely, cells including micro-cycles with depth of discharge of 0.5 % lasted for nearly 3000 equivalent full cycles, whereas cells aged under standard deep cycles lasted for no >1500. Nevertheless, if the number of deep cycles, disregarding micro-cycles, is the unit to measure battery use, then the degradation of cells with and without micro-cycles is similar. Based on this result, the number of cycles can be identified as a more accurate variable to measure the use of a cell, in comparison to charge throughput.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Soto","given":"Adrian"},{"family":"Berrueta","given":"Alberto"},{"family":"Mateos","given":"Miren"},{"family":"Sanchis","given":"Pablo"},{"family":"Ursúa","given":"Alfredo"}],"citation-key":"sotoImpactMicrocyclesLifetime2022","container-title":"Journal of Energy Storage","container-title-short":"Journal of Energy Storage","DOI":"10.1016/j.est.2022.105343","ISSN":"2352-152X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"105343","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Impact of micro-cycles on the lifetime of lithium-ion batteries: An experimental study","title-short":"Impact of micro-cycles on the lifetime of lithium-ion batteries","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352152X2201338X","volume":"55"},

Taken together, the pictures show how 20 years of research have improved our ability to undertake our professional responsibilities.

A simulation-based TEA is a cost-benefit analysis that simultaneously considers technical and economic factors. In addition, the method facilitates the development of the entire project and provides a systematic approach for examining the interrelationships between economic and technological aspects. When it comes to economic studies, it is intimately bonded with uncertainty. There are numerous uncertainty sources, classified in various ways. The uncertainty reflects “an inability to determine the precise value of one or more parameters affecting a system.” The variability refers to the different values a given parameter may take. This implies that a probability density function (PDF), for instance, can be employed to estimate and quantify the variability of a given parameter. The bias refers to “assumptions that skew an analysis in a certain direction while ignoring other legitimate alternatives, factors, or data.”","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,3]]},"citation-key":"TechnoEconomicLifeCycle","language":"en","title":"Techno-Economic and Life Cycle Cost Analysis","type":"webpage","URL":"https://encyclopedia.pub/entry/29125"},

  {"id":"teohLatticeMethodReal2007","abstract":"The deregulation policy introduces uncertainties into the power market. The power market uncertainties have increased the significance of two factors in decision analysis: financial risks and managerial flexibility. Real option analysis enables such flexibility to management. There are several major methods under real option analysis: traditional black-Scholes option-pricing method, lattice (binomial and trinomial) methods, Monte Carlo simulation method, and finite element (explicit, implicit, and Crank-Nicolson) method. This paper concentrates on the lattice method. Lattice model is easy to implement, appreciate and understand. However, when the investment duration is large (or the length of model period - step size is small), the lattice model becomes a massive bush of lattice, which is known as the curse of dimensionality. This paper proposes a new efficient methodology of solving the curse of dimensionality for the lattice model. The massive bush of lattice model can be reduced by analyzing the boundary of the lattice where the decision changes. This can be achieved via the implementation of value at risk into the lattice model. Besides reducing the degree of dimensionality, this new methodology also specifies \"when\" a decision changes. This is a very critical part in strategic budgeting planning. Timing and simplification yet maintaining high accuracy in analysis are essential in the new deregulated power economic uncertainties.","author":[{"family":"Teoh","given":"C.C."},{"family":"Sheble","given":"Gerald"}],"citation-key":"teohLatticeMethodReal2007","DOI":"10.1109/PCT.2007.4538422","ISBN":"978-1-4244-2189-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",8,1]]},"number-of-pages":"825","page":"830","source":"ResearchGate","title":"Lattice Method of Real Option Analysis - Solving the Curse of Dimensionality and Strategic Planning","type":"book"},

  {"id":"terziovskiOPERATIONSMAINTENANCEPRACTICES2008","abstract":"The aim of the study was to examine the impact of Operations and Maintenance (O&M) practices, individually and collectively, on power plant performance. Data were collected from more than 100 power plants in Australia and Malaysia. The reliability and validity (content, construct, and criterion) of the practice and performance measures were evaluated. Our study showed that the relationship between O&M practices and plant performance is significant and positive in a cross-sectional sense. Both people-oriented “soft” as well as technically-oriented “hard” practices were found to be positive and significant predictors of plant performance. This is consistent with literature on socio-technical systems theory that both “soft” and “hard” practices are required to complement each other to produce and sustain high performance. Among the practices, executive commitment and TPM1-orientation are the strongest significant predictors of plant performance. Our findings also highlight the impact of maintenance practices on plant performance compared to other practices such as long-term planning, customer focus, knowledge management, and employee involvement. Based on our study we conclude that Total Quality Management (TQM) and maintenance philosophies are sources of sustainable competitive advantage in the power generation sector. The implication of our research findings is that plant managers need to allocate more “softer” resources to the operations and maintenance function if they expect to increase the impact on plant availability.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Terziovski","given":"Milé"}],"citation-key":"terziovskiOPERATIONSMAINTENANCEPRACTICES2008","container-title":"Academy of Management Proceedings","container-title-short":"AMPROC","DOI":"10.5465/ambpp.2008.33653223","ISSN":"0065-0668, 2151-6561","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",8]]},"language":"en","page":"1-6","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE PRACTICES AND THEIR IMPACT ON POWER PLANT PERFORMANCE.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/ambpp.2008.33653223","volume":"2008"},

The reference A-USC unit without CCS achieves a net efficiency of 47.6% with CO2 emissions of 700 kgCO2/MWh. Relatively to subcritical units, the net efficiency of the A-USC is 8%-pts higher while CO2 emissions are 16.5% lower. For a CO2 removal rate of 90%, the net efficiency of the CCS integrated A-USC unit is 36.8%. The resulting net efficiency loss is 10.8%-pts and the electricity output penalty is 362.3 kWhel/tCO2 for present state CCS technology. The study continues with the assessment of interface quantities between the capture unit and the steam cycle affecting the performance of the A-USC. Improved CO2 absorbents could alleviate the net efficiency loss by 2–3%-pts, and enhanced CO2 compression strategies and advanced heat integration could further reduce the efficiency loss by 0.5–1.2%-pts and 0.4–0.6%-pts, respectively.

  {"id":"trottBuildingFoundationDataDriven2021","abstract":"Optimizing economic and public policy is critical to address socioeconomic issues and trade-offs, e.g., improving equality, productivity, or wellness, and poses a complex mechanism design problem. A policy designer needs to consider multiple objectives, policy levers, and behavioral responses from strategic actors who optimize for their individual objectives. Moreover, real-world policies should be explainable and robust to simulation-to-reality gaps, e.g., due to calibration issues. Existing approaches are often limited to a narrow set of policy levers or objectives that are hard to measure, do not yield explicit optimal policies, or do not consider strategic behavior, for example. Hence, it remains challenging to optimize policy in real-world scenarios. Here we show that the AI Economist framework enables effective, flexible, and interpretable policy design using two-level reinforcement learning (RL) and data-driven simulations. We validate our framework on optimizing the stringency of US state policies and Federal subsidies during a pandemic, e.g., COVID-19, using a simulation fitted to real data. We find that log-linear policies trained using RL significantly improve social welfare, based on both public health and economic outcomes, compared to past outcomes. Their behavior can be explained, e.g., well-performing policies respond strongly to changes in recovery and vaccination rates. They are also robust to calibration errors, e.g., infection rates that are over or underestimated. As of yet, real-world policymaking has not seen adoption of machine learning methods at large, including RL and AI-driven simulations. Our results show the potential of AI to guide policy design and improve social welfare amidst the complexity of the real world.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Trott","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Srinivasa","given":"Sunil"},{"family":"Wal","given":"Douwe","non-dropping-particle":"van der"},{"family":"Haneuse","given":"Sebastien"},{"family":"Zheng","given":"Stephan"}],"citation-key":"trottBuildingFoundationDataDriven2021","container-title":"arXiv.org","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,6]]},"language":"en","title":"Building a Foundation for Data-Driven, Interpretable, and Robust Policy Design using the AI Economist","type":"webpage","URL":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02904v1"},

  {"id":"ubaidillahStudyCarDemand2021","abstract":"Several developing Asian countries recorded a high level of private based motorisation, specifically car and motorcycle ownership. Continuous rise in the level of private motorisations may lead to issues such as traffic congestions, high fuel consumption and pollutions. For that reason, there is a need to investigate the determinant of car ownership and the interdependency between car and motorcycle ownership in Sarawak, Malaysia. This study used time series annual data using vector error correction model (VECM) from 1980 to 2018. Based on the analysis, it is found that gross domestic product, fuel price and population density are significant determinants of car ownership. The findings revealed that as the standard of living rises, car demand increases. At the state aggregate level, it is found that there is a substitution relationship between both modes. This indicates that people are highly likely to shift from motorcycle ownership to car ownership in the long run. Based on the findings, the policy recommendations in the study include encouraging shifts to alternative modes of transport through public transport reforms as well as improving facilities for a more sustainable mode of transportation in Sarawak.","author":[{"family":"Ubaidillah","given":"Nur"}],"citation-key":"ubaidillahStudyCarDemand2021","container-title":"International Journal of Business and Society","container-title-short":"International Journal of Business and Society","DOI":"10.33736/ijbs.3307.2020","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,23]]},"page":"997-1011","source":"ResearchGate","title":"A Study of Car Demand and Its Interdependency in Sarawak","type":"article-journal","volume":"21"},
  {"id":"ueckerdtSystemLCOEWhat2013","abstract":"LCOE (levelized costs of electricity) are a common metric for comparing power generating technologies. However, there is criticism particularly towards evaluating variable renewables like wind and solar PV (photovoltaics) power based on LCOE because it ignores variability and integration costs. We propose a new metric System LCOE that accounts for integration and generation costs. For this purpose we develop a new mathematical definition of integration costs that directly relates to economic theory. As a result System LCOE allow the economic comparison of generating technologies and deriving optimal quantities in particular for VRE (variable renewable sources). To demonstrate the new concept we quantify System LCOE from a simple power system model and literature values. We find that at high wind shares integration costs can be in the same range as generation costs of wind power and conventional plants in particular due to a cost component “profile costs” captured by the new definition. Integration costs increase with growing wind shares and might become an economic barrier to deploying VRE at high shares. System LCOE help understanding and resolving the challenge of integrating VRE and can guide research and policy makers in realizing a cost-efficient transformation towards an energy system with potentially high shares of variable renewables.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Ueckerdt","given":"Falko"},{"family":"Hirth","given":"Lion"},{"family":"Luderer","given":"Gunnar"},{"family":"Edenhofer","given":"Ottmar"}],"citation-key":"ueckerdtSystemLCOEWhat2013","container-title":"Energy","container-title-short":"Energy","DOI":"10.1016/j.energy.2013.10.072","ISSN":"0360-5442","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",12,15]]},"language":"en","page":"61-75","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"System LCOE: What are the costs of variable renewables?","title-short":"System LCOE","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544213009390","volume":"63"},

  {"id":"vantingScopingReviewDeep2021","abstract":"The increasing dependency on electricity and demand for renewable energy sources means that distributed system operators face new challenges in their grid. Accurate forecasts of electric load can solve these challenges. In recent years deep neural networks have become increasingly popular in research, and researchers have carried out many experiments to create the most accurate deep learning models. Players in the energy sector can exploit the increasing amount of energy-related data collected from smart meters to improve the grid’s operating quality. This review investigates state-of-the-art methodologies relating to energy load forecasting using deep neural networks. A thorough literature search is conducted, which outlines and analyses essential aspects regarding deep learning load forecasts in the energy domain. The literature suggests two main perspectives: demand-side management and grid control on the supply side. Each perspective has multiple applications with its challenges to achieve accurate forecasts; households, buildings, and grids. This paper recommends using a hybrid deep learning multivariate model consisting of a convolutional and recurrent neural network based on the scoping review. The suggested input variables should be historical consumption, weather, and day features. Combining the convolutional and recurrent networks ensures that the model learns as many repeating patterns and features in the data as possible.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Vanting","given":"Nicolai Bo"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Zheng"},{"family":"Jørgensen","given":"Bo Nørregaard"}],"citation-key":"vantingScopingReviewDeep2021","container-title":"Energy Informatics","container-title-short":"Energy Informatics","DOI":"10.1186/s42162-021-00148-6","ISSN":"2520-8942","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,24]]},"page":"49","source":"BioMed Central","title":"A scoping review of deep neural networks for electric load forecasting","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s42162-021-00148-6","volume":"4"},

  {"id":"vesaModelbasedStudyFinnish2019","abstract":"Electrified vehicles are facing challenges in diffusion as they are not just being introduced to the vehicle market as a new alternative, but instead they are trying to replace a market incumbent with the same purpose, excellent performance, and a lower cost. This implies that there is a zero-sum-game where one can only benefit at the expense of the other(s). In the field of system dynamics, such a problem is also referred as a success to successful or relative achievement problem archetype. Therein, a possible closed-loop solution is to introduce an external balancing force that can bring the system to a new equilibrium. Such an external force is often applied in the form of policies and legislative actions, which in turn can be studied and developed by means of system dynamics modelling.\nOn this basis, the goal of the thesis was to study the Finnish electrified vehicle market by means of system dynamics modelling and thereby to increase understanding of the effectiveness of different policies in the national context and the effects of external factors on electrified vehicle diffusion. In order to do this, relevant theoretical background and existing body of research were studied, and a dynamic hypothesis of the problematic behaviour was formulated. Then, using stock-and-flow maps the hypothesis was translated into a simulation model with the help of which effectiveness and impacts of current policy measures and external factors could be studied.\nThe analysis showed that while policy measures are needed, and they seem to benefit especially battery electric vehicles, differences in policy effectiveness are generally small and it seems that it is the system conditions that ultimately determine the diffusion speed of electrified vehicles. Purchase subsidies can induce battery electric vehicle adoption in the short term, but investments in charging infrastructure seem to more effective in the long term. Similar observations were done in the other categories as well. Further, model results were found to be sensitive to development of cost of kWh, weight put on usage costs versus purchase price, technological development rate of battery electric vehicles, and marketing efforts of electrified vehicle platform. While these introduce factors of uncertainty to the model results, they also highlight the meaning of these variables to market development and the role of system conditions in vehicle stock development.\nThis study concludes that the two key drivers of electrified vehicle diffusion are social exposure and relative attractiveness of electrified vehicles. The former induces word of mouth marketing, which has found to be a strong reinforcing causal structure. Through social exposure and word of mouth consumers become more willing to consider the market entrant as a realistic option. At the same time, however, the relative performance of that alternative has to be sufficiently high in comparison to their reference point, so that those consumers will actually make a purchase.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Vesa","given":"Roope"}],"citation-key":"vesaModelbasedStudyFinnish2019","event-place":"Finland","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","license":"This publication is copyrighted.

  {"id":"vilotijevicImprovedTechnoEconomicApproach2021","abstract":"Designing a small hydropower plant (SHPP) necessitates fulfillment of energy and ecological constraints, so a well-defined design flow is of the utmost significance. The main parameters of each SHPP are determined by appropriate techno-economic studies, whereas an improved approach to defining more precise SHPP installed parameter is presented in this paper. The SHPP installed parameter is the ratio of the design flow and averaged perennial flow obtained from the flow duration curve at the planned water intake location. Previous experiences in the design of SHPPs have shown that the SHPP installed parameter has a value in a wide range without the existence of an unambiguous equation for its determination. Therefore, with this aim, the thirty-eight (38) small watercources in the territory of Montenegro, denominated for the construction of SHPPs, have been investigated. SHPPs are divided into two groups depending on the installed capacity and the method of calculating the purchase price of electricity. For both groups, the range of SHPP installed parameter is determined according to the technical and economic criteria: the highest electricity production, the highest income, net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR), and payback period (PB).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Vilotijević","given":"Vidosava"},{"family":"Karadžić","given":"Uroš"},{"family":"Vujadinović","given":"Radoje"},{"family":"Kovijanić","given":"Vuko"},{"family":"Božić","given":"Ivan"}],"citation-key":"vilotijevicImprovedTechnoEconomicApproach2021","container-title":"Water","DOI":"10.3390/w13172419","ISSN":"2073-4441","issue":"17","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"17","page":"2419","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"An Improved Techno-Economic Approach to Determination of More Precise Installed Parameter for Small Hydropower Plants","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/13/17/2419","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"wangReliabilityModelingMethod2019","abstract":"Lithium-ion batteries are widely used as basic power supplies and storage units for large-scale electric drive products such as electric vehicles. Their reliability is directly related to the life and safe operation of the electric drive products. In fact, the cells have a dependent relationship with the degradation process and they affect the degradation rate of the entire battery pack, thereby affecting its reliability. At present, most research focuses on the reliability of battery packs and assumes that their cells are independent of each other, which may cause the reliability of the evaluation to deviate greatly from the actual level. In order to accurately assess the reliability of lithium-ion batteries, it is necessary to build a reliability model considering the dependency among cells for the overall degradation of lithium-ion battery packs. Therefore, in this study, based on a lithium-ion battery degradation test, the Wiener process is used to analyze the reliability of four basic configurations of lithium-ion battery packs. According to the degradation data of the battery packs, the Copula function is used to quantitatively describe the dependent relationship in the degradation process of a single battery, and the quantitative dependent relationship is combined with the reliability model to form a new reliability model. Finally, taking the battery system of Tesla S as an example, a feasible optimization method for battery pack design is provided based on the model constructed in this work.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Lizhi"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Yusheng"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xiaohong"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Zhuo"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Xuejiao"}],"citation-key":"wangReliabilityModelingMethod2019","container-title":"Materials","container-title-short":"Materials (Basel)","DOI":"10.3390/ma12071054","ISSN":"1996-1944","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,30]]},"page":"1054","PMCID":"PMC6479742","PMID":"30935052","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Reliability Modeling Method for Lithium-ion Battery Packs Considering the Dependency of Cell Degradations Based on a Regression Model and Copulas","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6479742/","volume":"12"},
  {"id":"wangSystemDynamicsApproach2023","abstract":"Technological learning curve models have been continuously used to estimate the cost development of solar photovoltaics (PV) for climate mitigation targets over time. They can integrate several technical sources that influence the learning process. Yet, the accurate and realistic learning curve that reflects the cost estimations of PV development is still challenging to determine. To address this question, we develop four hypothetical-alternative learning curve models by proposing different combinations of technological learning sources, including both local and global technological experience and knowledge stock. We specifically adopt the system dynamics approach to focus on the non-linear relationship and dynamic interaction between the cost development and technological learning source. By applying this approach to Chinese PV systems, the results reveal that the suitability and accuracy of learning curve models for cost estimation are dependent on the development stages of PV systems. At each stage, different models exhibit different levels of closure in cost estimation. Furthermore, our analysis underscores the critical role of incorporating global technical sources into learning curve models.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Rong"},{"family":"Hasanefendic","given":"Sandra"},{"family":"Von Hauff","given":"Elizabeth"},{"family":"Bossink","given":"Bart"}],"citation-key":"wangSystemDynamicsApproach2023","container-title":"Energies","DOI":"10.3390/en16248005","ISSN":"1996-1073","issue":"24","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"24","page":"8005","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"A System Dynamics Approach to Technological Learning Impact for the Cost Estimation of Solar Photovoltaics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/16/24/8005","volume":"16"},

  {"id":"wayEmpiricallyGroundedTechnology2022","abstract":"Rapidly decarbonizing the global energy system is critical for addressing climate change, but concerns about costs have been a barrier to implementation. Most energy-economy models have historically underestimated deployment rates for renewable energy technologies and overestimated their costs. These issues have driven calls for alternative approaches and more reliable technology forecasting methods. Here, we use an approach based on probabilistic cost forecasting methods that have been statistically validated by backtesting on more than 50 technologies. We generate probabilistic cost forecasts for solar energy, wind energy, batteries, and electrolyzers, conditional on deployment. We use these methods to estimate future energy system costs and explore how technology cost uncertainty propagates through to system costs in three different scenarios. Compared to continuing with a fossil fuel-based system, a rapid green energy transition will likely result in overall net savings of many trillions of dollars—even without accounting for climate damages or co-benefits of climate policy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Way","given":"Rupert"},{"family":"Ives","given":"Matthew C."},{"family":"Mealy","given":"Penny"},{"family":"Farmer","given":"J.

A no-transition scenario that maintains the current energy mix provides a benchmark. Under a rapid transition scenario, solar photovoltaics and wind are quickly deployed using batteries for short-term storage. Hydrogen-based fuels are used for long-term storage and nonelectriﬁable applications. Energy prices become lower than historical averages after 2030 and considerably lower after 2050. This yields an expected net present saving at any sensible discount rate; at 4% for example, we predict savings of $5.6 trillion. In contrast, a slower transition is more expensive, while a nuclear scenario is substantially more expensive.","author":[{"family":"Way","given":"Rupert"},{"family":"Mealy","given":"Penny"},{"family":"Farmer","given":"J Doyne"}],"citation-key":"wayEstimatingCostsEnergy","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Estimating the costs of energy transition scenarios using probabilistic forecasting methods","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"weiComprehensiveStudyDegradation2022","abstract":"Lithium-ion batteries on electric vehicles have been increasingly deployed for the enhancement of grid reliability and integration of renewable energy, while users are concerned about extra battery degradation caused by vehicle-to-grid (V2G) operations. This paper details a multi-year cycling study of commercial 24 Ah pouch batteries with Li(NiMnCo)O2 (NCM) cathode, varying the average state of charge (SOC), depth of discharge (DOD), and charging rate by 33 groups of experiment matrix. Based on the reduced freedom voltage parameter reconstruction (RF-VPR), a more efficient non-intrusive diagnosis is combined with incremental capacity (IC) analysis to evaluate the aging mechanisms including loss of lithium-ion inventory and loss of active material on the cathode and anode. By analyzing the evolution of indicator parameters and the cumulative degradation function (CDF) of the battery capacity, a non-linear degradation model with calendar and cyclic aging is established to evaluate the battery aging cost under different unmanaged charging (V0G) and V2G scenarios. The result shows that, although the extra energy throughput would cause cyclic degradation, discharging from SOC 90 to 65% by V2G will surprisingly alleviate the battery decaying by 0.95% compared to the EV charged within 90–100% SOC, due to the improvement of calendar life. By optimal charging strategies, the connection to the smart grid can potentially extend the EV battery life beyond the scenarios without V2G.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Wei","given":"Yifan"},{"family":"Yao","given":"Yuan"},{"family":"Pang","given":"Kang"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Chaojie"},{"family":"Han","given":"Xuebing"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Languang"},{"family":"Li","given":"Yalun"},{"family":"Qin","given":"Yudi"},{"family":"Zheng","given":"Yuejiu"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Hewu"},{"family":"Ouyang","given":"Minggao"}],"citation-key":"weiComprehensiveStudyDegradation2022","container-title":"Batteries","DOI":"10.3390/batteries8100188","ISSN":"2313-0105","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",10]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"10","page":"188","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"A Comprehensive Study of Degradation Characteristics and Mechanisms of Commercial Li(NiMnCo)O2 EV Batteries under Vehicle-To-Grid (V2G) Services","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/10/188","volume":"8"},

Accelerating stress levels, increasing frequencies of extreme events and strengthening intersystem connections suggest that conventional modelling approaches based on incremental changes in a single stress may provide poor estimates of the impact of climate and human activities on ecosystems. We conduct experiments on four models that simulate abrupt changes in the Chilika lagoon fishery, the Easter Island community, forest dieback and lake water quality—representing ecosystems with a range of anthropogenic interactions. Collapses occur sooner under increasing levels of primary stress but additional stresses and/or the inclusion of noise in all four models bring the collapses substantially closer to today by ~38–81%. We discuss the implications for further research and the need for humanity to be vigilant for signs that ecosystems are degrading even more rapidly than previously thought.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Willcock","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Cooper","given":"Gregory S."},{"family":"Addy","given":"John"},{"family":"Dearing","given":"John A."}],"citation-key":"willcockEarlierCollapseAnthropocene2023","container-title":"Nature Sustainability","container-title-short":"Nat Sustain","DOI":"10.1038/s41893-023-01157-x","ISSN":"2398-9629","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,22]]},"language":"en","license":"2023 The Author(s)","page":"1-12","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Earlier collapse of Anthropocene ecosystems driven by multiple faster and noisier drivers","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-023-01157-x"},

  {"id":"wilsonLocalAreaPopulation2022","abstract":"A new dataset of population projections for local areas of Australia is described. The areas comprise SA3 areas of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard, which mostly range in population between 30,000 and 130,000. The projections are launched from the 2020 Estimated Resident Populations published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics and extend out to 2035. They are available by sex and five year age group up to 80–84 with 85+ as the final age group and in five year projection intervals. The projections were prepared using the synthetic migration cohort-component model, a new model for population projections which requires much less input data than conventional projection models, and therefore involves much lower costs and production time. Despite this, a recent evaluation demonstrated respectable forecast accuracy, and greater accuracy than equivalent simple projection models producing populations by age and sex. The age-sex projections are constrained to independent age-sex national projections and local area projections of total populations. The dataset consists of local area projections for the whole of the country which is consistent in methods, input data, and projection outputs due to the use of one model. This is rare in Australia because local area projections are most commonly prepared by individual State/Territory Governments using different methods, data sources, projection assumptions (which can be influenced by State/Territory population policies), and time periods. These nationally consistent projection data should be useful for a wide range of local area planning, policy, and research purposes, such as childcare demand, school enrolments, power and water usage, aged care provision, store and business site selection, living arrangements and household projections, labour force projections, and transport modelling.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Wilson","given":"Tom"},{"family":"Grossman","given":"Irina"},{"family":"Temple","given":"Jeromey"}],"citation-key":"wilsonLocalAreaPopulation2022","container-title":"Data in Brief","container-title-short":"Data in Brief","DOI":"10.1016/j.dib.2022.108559","ISSN":"2352-3409","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,1]]},"page":"108559","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Local area population projections dataset for Australia","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340922007661","volume":"44"},

  {"id":"wolakIdentificationEstimationCost2003","abstract":"INTRODUCTIONThis paper presents several techniques for recovering cost function estimates for electricity generation from a model of optimal bidding behavior in a competitive electricity market. These procedures are applied to actual data from the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM1) to recover cost function estimates for a specific market participant. I find close agreement between the cost functions recovered from these procedures and those obtained from engineering estimates. The techniques developed in this paper for recovering cost function estimates are not limited to markets for electricity generation. They can be used to recover cost function estimates for a participant in any bid-based centralized market.There are number of uses for the procedures developed in this paper. The primary use is to measure the extent of market power possessed by a market participant using only bid information and market-clearing prices and quantities. A major research effort in empirical industrial organization is the measurement of market power. Bresnahan (1989) summarizes much of this research, although there has been an explosion of recent research on this general topic. The techniques presented in this paper are a logical extension of the techniques described by Bresnahan (1989) to bid-based markets.A major challenge for designers of competitive electricity markets is to devise market rules that limit the ability of generation unit owners to exercise market power. Market power is the ability of a firm owning generation assets to raise the market price by its bidding behavior and to profit from this price increase.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Wolak","given":"Frank A."}],"citation-key":"wolakIdentificationEstimationCost2003","collection-title":"Econometric Society Monographs","container-title":"Advances in Economics and Econometrics: Theory and Applications, Eighth World Congress","DOI":"10.1017/CBO9780511610257.006","editor":[{"family":"Hansen","given":"Lars Peter"},{"family":"Dewatripont","given":"Mathias"},{"family":"Turnovsky","given":"Stephen J."}],"event-place":"Cambridge","ISBN":"978-0-521-81873-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003"]]},"page":"133-169","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Identification and Estimation of Cost Functions Using Observed Bid Data: An Application to Electricity Markets","title-short":"Identification and Estimation of Cost Functions Using Observed Bid Data","type":"chapter","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/advances-in-economics-and-econometrics/identification-and-estimation-of-cost-functions-using-observed-bid-data-an-application-to-electricity-markets/7151C75ED62ACE1818CDAF2C23F2078F","volume":"2"},

Scientific scale forecasting of electric vehicles (EVs) is fundamental to promote EVs’ integration for transportation and electric power industries. To capture the evolution pattern, a system dynamics (SD) approach is proposed to simulate and forecast the scale of EVs. The proposed SD model can integrate various factors and quantify their relationship by comprehensive reasoning. Causal loop diagrams are designed to describe the relationship between factors and variables, and their quantifications are formulated by different business models and surveys. The main procedure for simulation includes survey, problem analysis, variable definition, feedback analysis, and model building. The effectiveness of the SD approach is verified by case studies. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis of the key factors, such as fuel price, subsidy policy, etc., is also conducted.","author":[{"family":"Xiang","given":"Yue"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Hao"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Ji"},{"family":"Niu","given":"Yi"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Jiahui"}],"citation-key":"xiangScaleEvolutionElectric2017","container-title":"IEEE Access","container-title-short":"IEEE Access","DOI":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2699318","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",4,28]]},"page":"1-1","source":"ResearchGate","title":"Scale Evolution of Electric Vehicles: A System Dynamics Approach","title-short":"Scale Evolution of Electric Vehicles","type":"article-journal","volume":"PP"},
  {"id":"xuFactoringCycleAging2017","abstract":"When participating in electricity markets, owners of battery energy storage systems must bid in such a way that their revenues will at least cover their true cost of operation. Since cycle aging of battery cells represents a substantial part of this operating cost, the cost of battery degradation must be factored in these bids. However, existing models of battery degradation either do not fit market clearing software or do not reflect the actual battery aging mechanism. In this paper we model battery cycle aging using a piecewise linear cost function, an approach that provides a close approximation of the cycle aging mechanism of electrochemical batteries and can be incorporated easily into existing market dispatch programs. By defining the marginal aging cost of each battery cycle, we can assess the actual operating profitability of batteries. A case study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model in maximizing the operating profit of a battery energy storage system taking part in the ISO New England energy and reserve markets.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Xu","given":"Bolun"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Jinye"},{"family":"Zheng","given":"Tongxin"},{"family":"Litvinov","given":"Eugene"},{"family":"Kirschen","given":"Daniel S."}],"citation-key":"xuFactoringCycleAging2017","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",7,26]]},"number":"arXiv:1707.04567","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Factoring the Cycle Aging Cost of Batteries Participating in Electricity Markets","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.04567"},

  {"id":"yamujalaMultiserviceBasedEconomic2022","abstract":"Grid-scale Battery Energy Storage (BES) technologies are advocated as key enablers for low-carbon pathways. High capital costs and limited revenue from capacity utilization for a specific service leave most of the storage assets under high investment risks. Economic viability of BES can be justified from their participation in multiple services. Most of the existing works on value stacking and economic viability assessment are limited to considering energy arbitrage, peak shaving, and frequency regulation. Non-consideration of other potential grid services like load following and ramp products results in inadequate economic feasibility assessment of storage projects. In this context, the paper attempts to analyze economic feasibility from stacked revenues of an optimally sized BES. Various combinations of six grid services - energy arbitrage, regulation, reserve, load following, peak shaving, and ramp products; are modeled to assess optimal portfolio of services for BES value stacking and economic viability. BES and conventional units are co-optimized for various services in hourly resolution and inter-day rolling horizon for a year using security-constrained scheduling framework. Economic analysis of BES is carried out using cash flows for various service combinations. Case studies conducted on IEEE RTS 24 and Great Britain test systems highlight that BES, with stacked services, can gain 80%–120% of the sum of individual revenues. BES investments are found to be economically viable with value stacking from 04 to 05 services.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Yamujala","given":"Sumanth"},{"family":"Jain","given":"Anjali"},{"family":"Bhakar","given":"Rohit"},{"family":"Mathur","given":"Jyotirmay"}],"citation-key":"yamujalaMultiserviceBasedEconomic2022","container-title":"Journal of Energy Storage","container-title-short":"Journal of Energy Storage","DOI":"10.1016/j.est.2022.104657","ISSN":"2352-152X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"104657","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Multi-service based economic valuation of grid-connected battery energy storage systems","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352152X22006715","volume":"52"},

The estimated operating life and annual average cost of the Li-ion ESS under different dead bands and SOC set-points are calculated. The case studies show that the estimated operating life of the Li-ion ESS under the actual operating condition differs significantly from the nominal life provided by the manufacturer under the standard condition and the full discharge mode.

  {"id":"yanFrequencyControlAncillary2020","abstract":"This thesis has critically analysed the current frequency control ancillary services (FCAS) market in the Australian national electricity market (NEM), and how it will need to respond to the increasing integration of variable renewable energy (VRE) in the power system. The operation of FCAS in the NEM was considered successful in the early 2010s as it had cheaper costs compared to other international markets. This was due to its spot market mechanism where prices would be constantly updated to the lowest bidding offer. Currently, the FCAS market is largely dependent on conventional power generators such as coal and natural gas. However, with the increasing penetration of VRE, FCAS costs have surged and there is a reduction in the availability of inertia in the power system to stabilise frequency. Hence, it has become urgent for the NEM to revise and enhance the current FCAS. As a result, frequency control techniques for VRE have been investigated and proposed to resolve the current predicament. It has been concluded that there are three possible FCAS options coupled with VRE for NEM to conduct further research and determine which pathway best suits the upcoming large VRE integration in its market. This includes: - Coupling VRE with controllers to provide their own FCAS - Coupling VRE with conventional generators to provide FCAS - Coupling VRE with energy storage system to provide bulk energy storage and FCAS","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Yan","given":"Honglei"}],"citation-key":"yanFrequencyControlAncillary2020","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",6,5]]},"language":"en-AU","publisher":"The University of Queensland","title":"Frequency Control Ancillary Services in the Australian National Electricity Market","type":"thesis","URL":"https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/data/UQ_248c9a3/Honglei_Yan_thesis.pdf?Expires=1670201286&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJKNBJ4MJBJNC6NLQ&Signature=Ix1-p-fxEZm8Dv2xCiKzr6VXnWsiPsy7A14sTQxjsUVuEJJnUqiYZtZ72GtGsbvCymnkrzFfQd-7rlCu6Fn1sUMoo8QwfOWZL8euERWbojmRoEvTqtfiQcgA0~Hje8RLp0k46Y53H-kAHfJWiaKSa76n3sHyWdexgA5-xYwndhycWcslOQ9C0UZ8890GOkVxFpsv0KZyuAP1nUOKpBqjpTURs1LKuPWawN6vlYNk4llc2a11rbVTY5ZSpuZKzkhczrlkTet4od5KHHf-XGMv5i9WN2YhpF1fGMqq1BteV~UvNXf3sndfLjYoH7uMpwQ80fEarsDdalb6HYyCj~5hpg__"},
  {"id":"yangExcellentThermophysicalProperties2021","abstract":"The demand for space heating and domestic hot water has caused an increase in building-energy consumption and severely constrains the electricity infrastructure. Herein, we developed the tailor-made sodium acetate trihydrate (SAT, salt hydrate phase change material) as the thermal storage media for thermal energy storage systems, which could effectively solve the mismatch between heat supply and demand. Multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) was employed as the nucleation agent of SAT, while other carbon-based materials, including carbon fiber, expanded graphite, and graphene nanoplates, were synergistically used as thermal conductivity and photothermal conversion enhancers. Ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) was innovatively adopted as a phase-change temperature regulator for SAT. The results showed that the supercooling degree of SAT decreased to 0.9 °C with the presence of MWCNTs. The thermal conductivity of SAT improved by 54.9%, and the photothermal conversion efficiency increased to 89.3% after integrating MWCNTs and GNPs into the SAT composite. Furthermore, the phase-change temperature of the SAT/MWCNTs composite, ranged from 57.5 ° C to 45.1 °C, could be prepared by adjusting NH4Cl contents for satisfying different application scenarios. Our results indicate that the prepared SAT composites with a latent heat of 250.2 J/g can be potentially used in different thermal energy storage systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Yang","given":"Haibin"},{"family":"Cui","given":"Hongzhi"},{"family":"Fung","given":"W.

Here, we report a Monte Carlo approach to explore a wide range of input assumptions to identify key cost drivers, targets, and localized conditions necessary for competitive stand-alone dedicated PV powered hydrogen electrolysis. We determine the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH), considering historical weather data for specific locations to model our PV system, and optimize its size compared to the electrolyzer. This analysis and its methods show the potential for green hydrogen production using off-grid PV, shows the merits of remote systems in areas of high solar resource, and provides cost and performance targets for electrolyzer technologies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Yates","given":"Jonathon"},{"family":"Daiyan","given":"Rahman"},{"family":"Patterson","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Egan","given":"Renate"},{"family":"Amal","given":"Rose"},{"family":"Ho-Baille","given":"Anita"},{"family":"Chang","given":"Nathan L."}],"citation-key":"yatesTechnoeconomicAnalysisHydrogen2020","container-title":"Cell Reports Physical Science","container-title-short":"Cell Reports Physical Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.xcrp.2020.100209","ISSN":"2666-3864","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,21]]},"language":"en","page":"100209","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Techno-economic Analysis of Hydrogen Electrolysis from Off-Grid Stand-Alone Photovoltaics Incorporating Uncertainty Analysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666386420302241","volume":"1"},

  {"id":"zhangImprovedCycleAging2022","abstract":"Battery energy storage systems (BESSs) have been widely used in power grids to improve their flexibility and reliability. However, the inevitable battery life degradation is the main cost in BESS operations. Thus, an accurate estimation of battery aging cost is strongly needed to cover the actual cost of BESSs. The existing models of battery life degradation either are not fully accurate to estimate the actual cost or are not solved easily because of their computation nonlinearity. In this paper, a piece-wise linear battery aging cost model with an accurate estimate of battery life degradation for BESSs is proposed to extend battery life and improve battery profits. In our method, the widely-used Arrhenius law is modified to quantify the battery life degradation affected by the depth of cycle. Further, a nonlinear battery cycle aging cost model is developed by finding the derivative of battery life degradation with respect to discharging power, which indicates the battery life degradation rate due to depth of cycle. To reduce the complexity of computation, a piece-wise linearization method is proposed to simplify the battery cycle aging cost model. Finally, the cycle aging cost model with an accurate estimation of battery life degradation is applied to the optimization dispatch in the day-ahead energy and auxiliary service market. The results show that the error of estimating the battery cycle aging cost of BESSs is less than 5% under proper piece-wise segment numbers. The profits are increased by 27% and the battery life is extended by 11% than the fixed cost method.","author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Leiqi"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Yanjie"},{"family":"Li","given":"Bo"},{"family":"Qian","given":"Xiao"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Shujun"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xiangjin"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xuesong"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Minyou"}],"citation-key":"zhangImprovedCycleAging2022","container-title":"IEEE Access","DOI":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3139075","ISSN":"2169-3536","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"page":"297-307","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Improved Cycle Aging Cost Model for Battery Energy Storage Systems Considering More Accurate Battery Life Degradation","type":"article-journal","volume":"10"},

Battery degradation is a nonnegligible issue when battery energy storage system participates in system design and operation strategies optimization. The health assessment and remaining cycle life estimation of battery gradually become a challenge and research hotspot in many engineering areas. In this paper, the battery capacity falling and internal resistance increase are presented on the basis of chemical reactions inside the battery. The general life prediction models are analysed from several aspects. The characteristics of them as well as their application scenarios are discussed in the survey. In addition, a novel weighted Ah ageing model with the introduction of the Ragone curve is proposed to provide a detailed understanding of the ageing processes.

  {"id":"zhangRemainingUsefulLife2017","abstract":"Longevity remains one of the key issues for Lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery technology. On-board Intelligent Battery Management Systems (BMS) implement health-conscious control algorithms in order to increase battery lifetime while maintaining the performance. For such algorithms, the information on Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of the battery is crucial for optimizing the battery performance and ensuring minimal degradation. However, accurate prediction of RUL remains one of the most challenging tasks until this date. In this paper, we present an online RUL estimation scheme for Li-ion batteries, which is designed from a thermal perspective. The key novelty lies in (i) leveraging thermal dynamics to predict RUL and, (ii) developing a hierarchical estimation algorithm with provable convergence properties. The algorithm consists of three stages working in cascade. The first two stages estimate the core temperature, State-of-Charge (SOC) and battery capacity based on a combination of thermal and Coulombic SOC model. The third stage receives this capacity information and in turn identifies a capacity fade aging model. Finally, we estimate the RUL by predicting the battery capacity fade over the cycles utilizing the identified aging model. A combination of sliding mode observers and nonlinear least-squares algorithm is utilized for designing the estimators. Simulation results illustrate the performance of the proposed RUL estimation scheme.","author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Dong"},{"family":"Dey","given":"Satadru"},{"family":"Perez","given":"Hector E."},{"family":"Moura","given":"Scott J."}],"citation-key":"zhangRemainingUsefulLife2017","container-title":"2017 American Control Conference (ACC)","DOI":"10.23919/ACC.2017.7963575","event-title":"2017 American Control Conference (ACC)","ISSN":"2378-5861","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",5]]},"page":"4042-4047","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Remaining useful life estimation of Lithium-ion batteries based on thermal dynamics","type":"paper-conference"},
