Normal-minus-one (N-1) is a reliability standard applied in electricity systems. 

In a normal operating state, all components of the electricity system are operating as required. By contrast, a contingency event occurs when a critical and difficult to replace system component fails.

A contingency event typically involves the unplanned failure of a transmission line, generator or transformer.

In order to maintain system reliability at a high standard (e.g. the system is available 99.998% of the time), redundant critical system components are installed and maintained but not operated unless a contingency event occurs.

Not utilising all of the system components under normal operating conditions means that there is an opportunity cost associated with the N-1 standard.

N-1 is sometimes referred to as a physical hedge.
