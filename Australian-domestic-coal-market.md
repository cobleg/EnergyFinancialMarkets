# Introduction
Coal use in Australia is almost completely confined to the electricity sector. Black and brown coal provide around two-thirds of national electricity generation, although this is down from 80% a decade ago as gas and new renewables have become more prominent. Coal-fired power plants are currently operating in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia [Australian electricity options: coal](https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp2021/AustralianElectricityOptionsCoal).
