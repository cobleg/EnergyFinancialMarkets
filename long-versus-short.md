# Overview
Financial market terms can be confusing. This articule explains what is mean by `short` and `long` with specific examples relating to electricity markets.

# Long position
A `long position` describes a situation in which a trader possesses an asset prior to establishing an obligation to sell that asset at a specified delivery date. 

Electricity suppliers that have the facilities required to supply electricity have a `long position` with respect to the physical supply of electricity.

# Short position
A `short position` describes a situation in which a trader has an obligation to sell an asset at a specified delivery date first without possessing the promised asset. The short trader needs to buy the required asset by the required delivery date to deliver on the obligation. [@ShortShortPosition]

Electricity retailers have a `short position` with respect to the physical supply of electricity when they have already promised to supply electricity to their customers without possessing the faciliteis needed to physically supply the electricity. 

# Short and long position form the basis to trade
The electricity supplier's long position in the physical supply of electricity and the retailer's short position, creates a basis for electricity trading between suppliers and retailers. 

# Hedging long and short positions
The delivery of electricity involves a degree of uncertainty because:
- There are many reasons why electricity supply systems fail e.g. loss of transmission line, loss of generation facility, cloudiness, wind variation etc
- Demand for electricity is volatile, being particularly affected by weather variables such as temperature, which can be hard to predict.

Given these uncertainties, it is often prudent for electricity suppliers and retailers to adopt hedging positions.

The positions adopted by electricity suppliers and retailers will be the opposite of their physical position. That is:
- An electricity supplier takes a `short position` in the futures market to offset the underlying `long position`.
- An electricity retailer takes a `long position` in the futures market to offset the underlying `short position`.
