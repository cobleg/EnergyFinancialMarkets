# Overview
Value-at-Risk (VaR) measures the capital reserves at risk given a defined holding period and at a specified probability of loss. In other words, VaR is the worst expected loss under *normal market conditions* over a specified time interval at a given level of confidence.

This metric was developed by J.P. Morgan in the 1990s as part of its [RiskMetrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RiskMetrics) methodology.

VaR is focused on quantifying the risk of financial loss at the end of a holding period (e.g. 1 month). 

Advantages of VaR include simple to calculate and understand. Some disadvantages are that it is subject to change (which can be unpredictable) and requires a judgement of what *normal market* conditions look like in terms of a proabability distribution. Also, it implies an assumption of a stable probability distribution over the holding period (i.e. a constant mean and standard deviation). 
# Calculating VaR
VaR is calculated via this procedure:
1. Define the holding period, e.g. 1 month or 1 year
2. Create a probability density function (can be a simple histogram of historical returns or asset prices)
3. Determine the downside cut-off probability as a quantile (e.g. 1 %). The question is, what is the value of the asset at the cut-off period. The VaR is the difference between the current value and the value at the 1% cutoff.

# Worked example
Spot wholesale electricity prices in the Queensland region of the [[National Electricity Market]]  traded around an average of $83.70 per MWh and a standard deviation of $340 per MWh over calendar year 2021. Assume a Normal distribution for spot prices and a 1% cut-off probability level for VaR. 
Q1. Calculate the cut-off price level.

In Excel set up a table with the mean price, standard deviation, the cut-off probability and the cut-off price. Set the cut-off price at any plausible number. 

Use the NormDist function in Excel to calculate the probability of encountering a spot price that is at or below a probability of the cut-off price. 

Then use Solver to adjust the value of the cut-off price that matches the cut-off probability threshold. The derived cut-off price is -$707.26 per MWh. 

The negative price might be surprising and requires checking. However, wholesale electricity prices have fallen below zero across NEM regions on multiple occasions during calendar year 2021.

Q2. Assume that an electricity supplier has a contract to sell electricity at $60 per MWh. What is the VaR?

The value-at-risk is: Contract Price less the Cut-off Price, which in this example is $$ $60 - -$707.26 = $60 + $707.26 = $767.26 $$
This suggests that in the worst-case scenario, the electricity supplier could realise a loss of $767.26 per MWh to supply electricity.
