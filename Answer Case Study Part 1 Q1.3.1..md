ABC Energy is exposed to a risk that wholesale spot prices exceed the transfer price with a 5% margin. Board approval is 30 days away.

The main risk is wholesale spot price variation relative to the fixed transfer price.

Possible ways to manage the risk are:
- A monthly futures contract that can be rolled consistently by month over the next two years. 
- Alternatively, a two-year futures contract. The forward price curve would determine if this offers a better cashflow outcome compared to a one-month futures contract. 
- A two-year flat swap with a strike price equal to the transfer price. If the spot price exceeds the strike price, ABC Energy would receive cash to cover the loss of the underlying short position. If the price is less than the strike price, then ABC Energy pays the difference. This cash outflow would be covered by the revenue received from the customer.
- A sculptured swap could better match the volume of the underlying customer profile. This would likely be an [[OTC]] traded swap, which may attract a higher premium to establish. So consideration is the trade-off between the improved hedge efficiency versus the higher premium compared to the flat swap agreement.
