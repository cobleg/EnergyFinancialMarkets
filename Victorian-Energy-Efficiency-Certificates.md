# Overview
Victorian energy efficiency certificates (VEECs) are electronic certificates created under the program when certain energy efficiency activities are undertaken in residentialÂ  or non-residential premises. Each certificate represents one tonne of greenhouse gas emissions reduction (CO2-e).

Once created certificates can be sold to energy retailers who have a liability under the program to surrender a certain number of certificates each year.

The State Government of Victoria sets an annual target of approximately seven million tonnes of CO2-e abatement per year.
