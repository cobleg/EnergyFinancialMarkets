Domestic gas prices have trended down below the $12/GJ price cap due to several factors:
- Increased supply relative to demand in LNG markets (Asia, Europe and the USA) reflected in higher gas inventories.
- Heads of Agreement which requires uncontracted gas to be offered first in the Australian domestic market.
- Increased competition from gas producers as the level of gas prices has lifted higher than the historical average.
- Some demand destruction with Incitec-Pivot (a major gas consumer) announcing closure.
