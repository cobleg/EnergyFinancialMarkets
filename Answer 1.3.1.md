A renewable electricity generator (e.g. wind power or solar power) is a variable (or intermittent) generator, meaning that it cannot supply power at the required reliability of 99.998% of the time.

The forced outages that would occur would need to be supplied by an alternative generator. Either the owner of the renewable electricity generator or the purchaser would need to cover the supply gaps, exposing them either to a higher cost.

Those supply gap choices would be the spot wholesale market or a back-up source of supply such as a thermal generator, battery energy storage resource.
