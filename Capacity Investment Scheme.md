# Definition
> The Capacity Investment Scheme (CIS) is a national framework and an Australian Government initiative to encourage new investment in renewable capacity, such as wind and solar, and clean dispatchable capacity.

[Implementation Design Paper - Capacity Investment Scheme](Implementation%20Design%20Paper%20-%20Capacity%20Investment%20Scheme.md) 
# Objective
The objective is to:
- Deliver an additional 32 GW of new capacity by 2030
- Supporting electricity generation growth and reliability in Australia's rapidly changing electricity markets as aging thermal power stations exit.
- Support the delivery of the Australian Government's 82% renewable electricity by 2030 target.

# Design principles
The design principles guiding the CIS are:
- **Maintaining momentum** by accelerating the investment timeline for projects already in the advanced planning stage to deliver new $CO_2$-e emissions-free electricity supply capacity.
- **Stimulate investment** by providing long-term certainty for financiers through a combination of long-term financial underwriting offered to Projects and a clear, transparent tender process used to set key commercial terms in the CIS agreement (CISA).
- **Complementing existing market operations** by avoiding imposing operational conditions that may conflict with existing operating rules. The CISA can be integrated into a portfolio of [[swap]] contracts and [[tolling agreements]]. 
- **Tender product adaptability** which will select projects that support energy system reliability and lower electricity prices.
- **Supporting local communities and first nations people**

In short, the CIS design aims to reduce risks for proponents of renewable energy and clean dispatchable projects while preserving existing electricity market signals.

# CISA products
There are two defined products:
- **Clean Dispatchable CISA** applies to a *clean dispatchable generator* (e.g. battery and pumped hydro) at a registered capacity for 2 or more hours. The contract term is 15 years. 
- **Generation CISA** applies to generators (i.e. solar and wind power stations)

Eligible facilities have the following properties:
- Registered or intended to be registered with the Australian Electricity Market Operator (AEMO) as a generator.
- Are facilities that *do not* emit $CO_2$-e gases. 
- Are commercially defined as defined in the section: [Capacity Investment Scheme#Key Commercial Terms](Capacity%20Investment%20Scheme.md)
# Payment mechanisms
## Generation CISA
The Generation CISA will provide revenue underwriting for net revenue per MWh of generation sent out by a facility. This contract structure is shown below:

## Clean Dispatchable CISA
The Clean Dispatch CISA is similar in design

# Key commercial terms
The following are the defined commercial terms:
- **Ownership structure**: A project must be owned by a [[SPV]] that has all the assets required to undertake the project. The [[SPV]] must  be:
	- the Project Operator for the CISA
	- a registered [[NEM]] participant and receive all financial value associated with the Project.
	The Project Operator must:
		- be the counterparty to all revenue contracts (e.g. for a [[PPA]] )
		- must not carry on any other business other than the Project.
- **Project characteristics**: are required (e.g. nameplate capacity).
- **Support term**: spans up to maximum of 15 years.
- **Payment mechanism**: 
	- Quarterly payments for the first three quarters of the financial year. An annual reconciliation payment (Annual Adjustment Payment) will be made, subject to an annual cap.
	- Payments made according to the Project's revenue for each period, compared to its revenue floor and ceiling.
	- The underwriting mechanism is based on a project's net revenue, which is the sum of all revenue for the project minus costs from:
		- For storage projects, costs in relation to the import of electricity from the network.
		- Costs for Ancillary Services Network Support Services, or System Support Services.
		- Other costs incurred under the National Electricity Rules (excluding fines or penalties)
		- Any payments under and Eligible Wholesale Contract (excluding liquidated damages, warranty payments, or non-performance payments).
- **Contracted Percentage**: up to a maximum of the Project's capacity.
- **Escalation**: The Floor Price and Sharing/Ceiling Price will be bid ($/MWh) for each supported year. Escalation is allowed as a bid negotiation point.
- **Performance pay requirements**: the Project Operator must:
	- Operate the project following best industry practice, including maximising availability of the Project and revenues for the Project.
	- Respond to price signals in the electricity market.
	For the Generation CISA, the performance criteria are:
	- **Minimum dispatch**: Satisfy the performance pay requirement of being dispatched for at least 75% of [[P90]] operational demand each year).
	For the Clean Dispatchable CISA, the performance criteria are:
	- **Performance Event**: the project must bid at least 50% of its contracted capacity during an actual Lack of Reserve (LoR) 3 event.
	- **Storage capacity**: the project must have a tested storage capacity of at least the CISA schedule capacity.
	- **Availability**: the project must be available at least 90% during the support year.
