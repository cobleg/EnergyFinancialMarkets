# Objective
The objective is to:
- Deliver an additional 32 GW of new capacity by 2030
- Supporting electricity generation growth and reliability in Australia's rapidly changing electricity markets as aging thermal power stations exit.
- Support the delivery of the Australian Government's 82% renewable electricity by 2030 target.

# Design principles
The design principles guiding the CIS are:
- **Maintaining momentum** by accelerating the investment timeline for projects alreding in the advanced planning stage to deliver new $CO_2$-e emissions-free electricity supply capacity.
- **Stimulate investment** by providing long-term certainty for financiers through a combination of long-term financial underwriting offered to Projects and a clear, transparent tender process used to set key commercial terms in the CIS agreement (CISA).
- **Complementing existing market operations** by avoiding imposing operational conditions that may conflict with existing operating rules. The CISA can be integrated into a portfolio of [[swap]] contracts and [[tolling agreements]]. 
- **Tender product adaptability** which will select projects that support energy system reliability and lower electricity prices.
- **Supporting local communities and first nations people**
