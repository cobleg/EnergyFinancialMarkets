# Definition
> The Capacity Investment Scheme (CIS) is a national framework and an Australian Government initiative to encourage new investment in renewable capacity, such as wind and solar, and clean dispatchable capacity.

[Implementation Design Paper - Capacity Investment Scheme](Implementation%20Design%20Paper%20-%20Capacity%20Investment%20Scheme.md) 
# Objective
The objective is to:
- Deliver an additional 32 GW of new capacity by 2030
- Supporting electricity generation growth and reliability in Australia's rapidly changing electricity markets as aging thermal power stations exit.
- Support the delivery of the Australian Government's 82% renewable electricity by 2030 target.

# Design principles
The design principles guiding the CIS are:
- **Maintaining momentum** by accelerating the investment timeline for projects already in the advanced planning stage to deliver new $CO_2$-e emissions-free electricity supply capacity.
- **Stimulate investment** by providing long-term certainty for financiers through a combination of long-term financial underwriting offered to Projects and a clear, transparent tender process used to set key commercial terms in the CIS agreement (CISA).
- **Complementing existing market operations** by avoiding imposing operational conditions that may conflict with existing operating rules. The CISA can be integrated into a portfolio of [[swap]] contracts and [[tolling agreements]]. 
- **Tender product adaptability** which will select projects that support energy system reliability and lower electricity prices.
- **Supporting local communities and first nations people**

In short, the CIS design aims to reduce risks for proponents of renewable energy and clean dispatchable projects while preserving existing electricity market signals.

# CISA products
There are two defined products:
- **Clean Dispatchable CISA** applies to a *clean dispatchable generator* (e.g. battery and pumped hydro) at a registered capacity for 2 or more hours. The contract term is 15 years. 
- **Generation CISA** applies to generators (i.e. solar and wind power stations)

Eligible facilities have the following properties:
- Registered or intended to be registered with the Australian Electricity Market Operator (AEMO) as a generator.
- 
# Payment mechanisms
## Generation CISA
The Generation CISA will provide revenue underwriting for net revenue per MWh of generation sent out by a facility. This contract structure is shown below:

# Key commercial terms
The following are the commercial terms:
- Satisfy the performance pay requirement of being dispatched for at least 75% of [[P90]] operational demand each year).
-
