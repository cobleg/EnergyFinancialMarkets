The Diverse Energy business plan is mentioned in the Lesson 2.5 course notes:
- Provide electricity during NEM peak demand periods.
- Maintain gas supply storage so that the cost of gas consumed during these periods reduces the likelihood of a profit squeeze.
- Revenue mix is 50% domestic gas sales and 50% electricity volume sales.

Two issues with the volume limit use are:
- Half of the revenue (electricity sales) is limited by one-third of potential volume output. This represents an opportunity cost.
- Peak demand periods imply a higher electricity price, which implies a price-based opportunity cost.
