# Overview
The volatile nature of wholesale electricity markets highlights a multitude of financial risks. It pays to analyse the sources of these risks carefully and determine appropriate risk management strategies.

These will likely be contingency based, with a key distinction made between a normally operating market and an abnormal operating market.

# Risk analytic methods
There are a variety of analytical methods for asessing financial risk:
- [[value-at-risk]] [VaR](value-at-risk.md) 
- [[gross-margin-at-risk]] [GMaR](gross-margin-at-risk.md)
- [[cashflow-at-risk]] [CFaR](cashflow-at-risk)

Other methods include [[sensitivity analysis]] [SA](sensitivity analysis.md). 

# Derivatives and hedging
There are both over-the-counter and exchange traded derivatives available to [[hedge]][](hedge.md) exposure to the wholesale electricity market.

For exchange traded derivatives, the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) provides helpful information, such as this web page: [Australian Electricity Derivatives](https://www.asxenergy.com.au/products/electricity_futures).
