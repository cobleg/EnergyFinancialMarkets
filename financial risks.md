# Overview
The volatile nature of wholesale electricity markets highlights a multitude of financial risks. It pays to analyse the sources of these risks carefully and determine appropriate risk management strategies.

These will likely be contingency based, with a key distinction made between a normally operating market and an abnormal operating market.

# Risk analytic methods
There are a variety of analytical methods for asessing financial risk:
- [[value-at-risk]] (VaR)
- [[gross-margin-at-risk]] (GMaR)
- [[cashflow-at risk]] (CFaR)

Other methods include [[sensitivity analysis]]. 

# Derivatives and hedging
There are both over-the-counter and exchange traded derivatives available to hedge exposure to the wholesale electricity market.

For exchange traded derivatives, the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) provides helpful information, such as this web page: [Australian Electricity Derivatives](https://www.asxenergy.com.au/products/electricity_futures).
