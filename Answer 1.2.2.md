A simple sensitivity analysis consisting of parallel shifts in electricity spot and forward prices provides the opportunity to observe the change in the portfolio value. These shifts can range across different probability levels given the current spot price.

This would indicate what the limits of appropriate hedging are and the consequences of over-heading and under-hedging on portfolio value.

Parallel shifts in the spot price reflect an instantaneous shift in the entire risk profile (measured by the average dispersion of the spot price). One advantage is the realistic reflection of an unplanned loss of a significant generation or load facility.
	- Use of forward prices captures the market's risk bias, which may efficiently reflect all relevant information about future risk.
	- Parallel shift in the forward curve would capture an instantaneous change in future risk profile. One advantage is the shift in the market's assessement of future risk.
	- One disadvantage is that the parallel shift may not reflect an accurate measure of the change in credible (or likely) risk. The key is the magnitude of the shift - how is that determined?
	- Another disadvantage is that the parallel shift might not be readily understood or accepted by senior management. This may require discussion and agreement for something that is an ad-hoc, one-off issue.
