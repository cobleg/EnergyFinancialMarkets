The Energy Transition refers to the gradual replacement of fossil-fuel based energy and transportation technology. 

The energy transition is being driven by Australian Government policy designed to deliver on its targets:
- By 2030, reduce greenhouse gas emissions of 43% below 2005 levels.
- By 2050, achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions.
