# Overview
The challenges presented by [Variable Renewable Energy](VRE.md) can be almost eliminated by adding `firm capacity`.  

# Definition
The term `firm capacity` refers to the ability to deliver the contracted level of energy (or electrical power) over a specified time interval.

Note that an augmentation to a VRE system that improves its reliability is referred to as `firming capacity`. 

# Examples
The primary example of `firming capacity` is the addition of a battery or some other form of energy storage. However, the term can also be applied to non-renewable energy systems such as open-cycle gas turbines.
