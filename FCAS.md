>FCAS is a [NEM](NEM.md)-specific name applied to a group of services that help maintain our power system at 50Hz.  As demand for electricity changes continuously across the power system, the generation (from whichever source!) is adjusted to keep these two items matched.  Too much demand without enough generation, and the frequency will fall.  Too much generation for the given demand and frequency will rise.  If the frequency falls outside the 47-52Hz range, the power system will begin to collapse to protect the equipment and we will have blackouts as occurred in South Australia in September 2016.
