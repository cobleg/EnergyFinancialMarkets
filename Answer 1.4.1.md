## Diverse Energy data
Debt to equity ratio is 60:40
Number of open cycle units: 4
Capacity of each unit: 250 MW
Capacity factor: 40% to 50%
Auxiliary energy loss is 4%
Marginal Loss Factor of 0.95
Revenue mix is 50% domestic gas sales and 50% electricity generation.

Commodity price exposure:
- Domestic gas: $6.50/GJ
