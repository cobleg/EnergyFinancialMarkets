# Definition
> **Systems thinking** is a way of making sense of the complexity of the world by looking at it in terms of wholes and relationships rather than by splitting it down into its parts.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_thinking#cite_note-1) It has been used as a way of exploring and developing effective action in complex contexts.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_thinking#cite_note-2) Systems thinking draws on and contributes to [systems theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_theory "Systems theory") and the [system sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_science "Systems science").
