# Definition
A `game` is a framework for analysing the strategic interactions between agents (AKA players). A game consists of:

-   `Players`: a collection of decision-makers otherwise known as agents
-   `Information states`: of each player at each decision time
-   `Feasible moves`: decisions, actions, plays that each player can choose to make in each possible information state
-   `Procedure`Â : for determining how the move choices of all the players collectively determine the possible outcomes of the game
-   `Preferences`: of the individual players over possible outcomes, typically measured by a [[utility function]] or [[payoff function]].
