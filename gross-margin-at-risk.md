# Definition
Gross margin is the percentage of gross profit over total revenue. Gross profit is determined by deducting the direct costs associated with selling goods or services from revenue received. So Gross Margin at Risk (GMaR) is a summary statistic of the risk to gross profit due to variability in revenue and direct costs.
