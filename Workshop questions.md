# Question 1
You have just started a role as Environmental Advisor for BHP, who has [pledged](https://www.bhp.com/sustainability/climate-change/) to reduce its CO2-e emissions to a level aligned with 1.5°C warming by year 2100. The challenge for BHP is how to reduce the CO2-e emissions in a way that does not harm the business overall, given BHP’s main business is the mining of fossil fuels and natural minerals (such as copper, iron ore, and uranium). 

1.  Identify one environmental market BHP could use to reduce its CO2-e emissions in a financially-sustainable way for the business. What are 2-3 key risks faced with using this market? (see this for some background information:
    
	Recently, [ACCUs](Australian-carbon-credit-units.md) have been [criticised](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/23/australias-carbon-credit-scheme-largely-a-sham-says-whistleblower-who-tried-to-rein-it-in) by the likes of Andrew McIntosh. Briefly explain why

## Key points
Available environmental markets:
- [Large-scale generation certificate scheme](large-scale-generation-certificates.md) 
- [ACCU market](Australian-carbon-credit-units.md)
- [Victorian Energy Efficiency Certificates](Victorian-Energy-Efficiency-Certificates.md) 

A few key risks
- Cessation of the scheme such as the Emissions Trading Scheme, the NSW Greenhouse Gas Abatement Scheme etc
- Reputational issues such as scandals related to scheme rorts
- Price risk since ACCUs and LGCs are subjected to market forces, which implies price volatility induced by imbalances between the demand and supply of certificates.
	- International competition for certificates, pushing up the price

ACCUs have been criticised for failing to deliver new carbon abatement. In essence, double-counting abatements covered in other schemes or claiming credit for abatement that occurs without human intervention, e.g. via existing old-growth forests.

# Question 2
One of the contributors to the increase in wholesale electricity prices during the 2017-2019 period was the increase in gas prices. For the history of Australia’s east coast gas market, up to 2015, wholesale gas prices were rarely above $4/GJ, reflecting the low historical cost of domestic production. This changed in 2015, with the development of three LNG export terminals. 

1.  Why did the building of the three LNG terminals lead to rising domestic gas prices?
    **Answer**: Exposed the domestic gas market to international competition
    
2.  To what price did the domestic gas price rise and converge to?
	**Answer**: By 2016-17 the domestic gas price hight $10 per GJ. By 2021-22, the gas price  exceeded $20 per GJ [@GasMarketPrices2020] 
    
3.  Why were international prices higher than domestic prices, and to what extent?
    **Answer**: International natural gas prices are tradititionally linked to the internation oil price, but more recently, competition for LNG has increased as various nations, particularly in Europe express a preference for natural gas over petroleum and other oil-based products.

4.  In what ways can gas prices impact electricity prices?
    
5.  What do you think are the risks to future gas prices (both in terms of potential drivers of higher and lower gas prices)?
