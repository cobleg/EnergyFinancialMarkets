# Overview
> Cashflow at Risk (CFaR) provides a summary statistic of the risk inherent in the firm's portfolio of cash flows. The CFaR measure provides a summary statistic of the risk inherent in the firm’s portfolio of cash flows. It essentially represents the shortfall of cash flow, associated with a certain probability, a company could experience over a certain time period. Such a modelling effort can be helpful in managing the firm’s operating cash flow and provide a sense of the firm’s overall liquidity risk over a certain time period (Jankensgard, 2008).

CFaR can be contrasted to [[value-at-risk]] (VaR) - the underlying objective is the same, but CFaR goes beyond VaR to examine the overall risk of a firm's total cashflow. By contrast, VaR is focused on financial risks emanating from traded financial instruments, which is a subset of a firm's total cashflow.

CFaR is useful for firms that have incurred debt as part of their financial structure, helping to balance the benefits of debt against the risk of it imposing a shortfall of cash. The risk of cash shortfall arises because debt payments are typically fixed whereas revenue can be variable.
