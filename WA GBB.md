> The Western Australia Gas Bulletin Board (WA GBB) is a public website that publishes forecast and historical data on the domestic production, transmission, storage and usage of natural gas in Western Australia. It was formally established (alongside the WA Gas Statement of Opportunities) in 2013 under WA’s Gas Services Information (GSI) Rules. This section of the site contains information about both the WA GBB and the GSI.
