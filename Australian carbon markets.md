# Introduction
The Australian Government is facilitating the expansion of the renewable energy system through the operation of serveral funds. Combined, these are referred as the [Australian carbon markets](http://www.cleanenergyregulator.gov.au/Infohub/Markets/Pages/About-Carbon-Markets.aspx) by the Clean Energy Regulator.

The funds are the:
- Emissions Reduction Fund, which supplies [[Australian-carbon-credit-units]], #ACCU; and
- Renewable Energy Target, which creates tradable [[large-scale-generation-certificates]], #LGC, and [[small-scale technology certificates]], #STC.
