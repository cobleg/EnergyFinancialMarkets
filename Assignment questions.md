#### 1.1 Coal plants in the NEM (6 Marks total)

The retirement of coal-fired power stations will likely change electricity spot price outcomes in the NEM.     

1.  Using credible reference material, establish the number of coal-fired generators in the NEM, noting announced closure dates, their respective capacity (MW), and their size relative to the total generation capacity by year. Present your findings in a chart or table. **(4 marks)**

2.  What are the main factors determining the profitability of coal-fired generation? What impact will retirement of coal-fired generation have on the profitability of the remaining coal-fired generation plant. **(2 marks)**  
    

#### 1.2 Market risk in the NEM (9 marks total)  

Spark Energy has 1,500 MW of coal and gas-powered generation in QLD. It also has a simple hedge portfolio of 1,000 MW in flat swaps with an average strike price of $60/MWh for the next 12 months (8,760hrs). Spark Energy’s risk manager wishes to calculate the VaR associated with its hedge portfolio for a holding period equal to the time between risk committee meetings (one month).  

1.  Using market research to establish realistic volatility parameters, determine a simple VaR for the existing hedge portfolio **(4 marks)**  
    

2.  Spark Energy’s risk manager does not feel that VaR gives the full picture of Spark Energy’s exposure to electricity price risk. The risk manager is considering using simple sensitivity analysis with parallel shifts in electricity spot and forward prices. What advantages and disadvantages does this sensitivity analysis have relative to the previous VaR analysis? **(2 marks)**
    
3.  What other ’at risk’ metrics might be useful to Spark Energy’s risk manager in addition to VaR and what are their advantages? **(3 marks)** 
    

#### 1.3 Spot price risk in the NEM (6 marks total)

Five-minute settlement was introduced on 1 October 2021.  

1.  Identify two of the anticipated benefits of the change. **(2 marks)**
    

2.  Using actual 5-minute spot price data for VIC, produce summary statistics (average, standard deviation, etc.) for the historical spot price distribution, dividing your data into the following two time periods: (i) 12am on 1 October 2020 to 11.55pm on 31 March 2021, and (ii) 12am on 1 October 2021 to 11.55pm on 31 March 2022. Explain any discernible differences in spot price outcomes between the two periods. Data can be sourced from AEMO (https://aemo.com.au/energy-systems/electricity/national-electricity-market-nem/data-nem/aggregated-data). **(4 marks)**  
    

#### 1.4 Setting portfolio limits for Diverse Energy  (6 marks total) 

Ahead of the commissioning of AMBER1, Diverse recruited Ms Bec Sharp, an experienced risk manager in the Australian energy sector. Bec Sharp’s immediate role is to establish a governance framework and trading infrastructure for managing the market risk exposures of Diverse Energy and its AMBER1 generation portfolio.

Bec Sharp is conscious that her budget for establishing trading infrastructure and placing human resources in risk and analytical roles is limited. Her experience with acquiring sophisticated energy risk systems is that they are expensive and have a long lead time before they can be successfully delivered into production. She is also aware that skilled human resources will be required to ensure that the inputs and risk parameters of these systems undergo calibration and recalibration.

As a result, she has decided to propose _N-1_ volume limits as the methodology for AMBER1’s electricity trading portfolio limits.

  

1.  Using the limited data available to Bec, calculate and propose an _N-1_ volume limit for Diverse Energy’s electricity hedging portfolio limit. **(2 marks)** 
2.  Identify two reasons influencing Bec’s decision to select _N-1_ as her preferred initial approach. (2 marks)
3.  Identify the issues with volume limit use, with specific reference to the business plan and market risks of Diverse Energy. (2 marks)
