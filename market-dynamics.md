# Introduction
[Market dynamics](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/economics/market-dynamics/) refer to the forces that impact the prices and the behaviours of producers and consumers. A fluctuation in the demand and supply of a given product or service creates pricing signals, which may in turn affect future market demand and supply decisions.

Since [[markets-are-interconnected]], this can lead to the transmittance of pricing signals to other markets, adding to the complexity of inter-dependent market dynamics. 

# Interdependencies between energy and environmental markets

Australian energy market, such as the [[National-Electricity-Market]] are being influenced by the market dynamics in the [[Australian-carbon-markets]]. This interaction is also stimulating changing market dynamics in both the [[Australian-domestic-gas-market]] and the [[Australian-domestic-coal-market]].
