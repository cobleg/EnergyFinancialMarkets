The Short Term Trading Market (STTM) is a market-based mechanism established by the Australian Energy Market Operator ([[AEMO]]) for trading natural gas at designated hubs. It aims to facilitate efficient gas trading and supply by providing transparent price signals and allowing market participants to manage their gas requirements and imbalances.

### Key Features:

1. **Market Hubs**:
   - The STTM operates at several key hubs, including Sydney, Adelaide, and Brisbane. These hubs are points where gas is injected and withdrawn from the pipeline system, and trading activities are centralized.

2. **Market Participants**:
   - Participants include shippers, retailers, large consumers, and producers. These entities can submit bids and offers to buy or sell gas for the next day.

3. **Daily Market**:
   - The STTM is a day-ahead market where gas is traded for delivery the following day. Participants submit their bids and offers based on their forecasted needs and supplies.

4. **Price Discovery**:
   - Prices are determined through a competitive bidding process. The market clears at a price where supply meets demand, providing a transparent and market-based price signal for gas.

5. **Balancing Mechanism**:
   - The STTM includes mechanisms to balance supply and demand, allowing participants to manage their imbalances. This helps ensure system reliability and operational efficiency.

6. **Settlement**:
   - After the gas day, AEMO settles the market based on actual gas flows and market prices. Participants are charged or credited based on their transactions and any imbalances they incur.

7. **Transparency and Reporting**:
   - The STTM provides detailed market data and reports to participants and the public, enhancing transparency and aiding market analysis.

8. **Regulation and Compliance**:
   - The market is regulated to ensure fair trading practices, and participants must comply with market rules and procedures set by AEMO.

The STTM is a critical component of Australia's gas market framework, aiming to enhance the efficiency, reliability, and transparency of gas trading and supply.
