# Definition
[A hedge is an investment position intended to offset potential financial losses that may be incurred by an associated investment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_(finance)). 

> Hedging is the practice of taking a position in one market to offset and balance against the risk adopted by assuming a position in a contrary or opposing market or investment. The word hedge is from Old EnglishÂ _hecg_, originally any fence, living or artificial. The first known use of the word as a verb meaning 'dodge, evade' dates from the 1590s; that of 'insure oneself against loss,' as in a bet, is from the 1670s.

Wholesale electricity trading implies exposure to highly volatile spot prices. Spot prices can vary between -$1,000 to $15,100 per MWh. Both buyers and sellers need a way of reducing the uncertainty associated with these volatile prices.

A simple physical strategy would be to store electrical energy in batteries, charging the batteries from the electricity grid when prices are low and discharging from the batteries when prices are high. However, batteries and other forms of energy storage are still expensive and impractical for most electricity users. Indeed, despite the price volatility, the electricity grid still offers great value over self-supply most of the time. 

Most hedging strategies will seek to [[swap]] the volatile cashflow associated with wholesale market trading with less volatile cashflow. This makes it easier to ensure sufficient cash is available to operate a business and maintain a continuous service of electrical power.

There are a variety of hedging instruments available, both over-the-counter as well as via securities exchanges such as the Australian Securities Exchange.
