# Definition
[A hedge is an investment position intended to offset potential financial losses that may be incurred by an associated investment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_(finance)). 

> Hedging is the practice of taking a position in one market to offset and balance against the risk adopted by assuming a position in a contrary or opposing market or investment. The word hedge is from Old EnglishÂ _hecg_, originally any fence, living or artificial. The first known use of the word as a verb meaning 'dodge, evade' dates from the 1590s; that of 'insure oneself against loss,' as in a bet, is from the 1670s.
