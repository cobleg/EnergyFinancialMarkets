In February 2023, the LGC spot price dropped to a low of $39.75. This February drop is typical following the annual RPP surrender. The increasing LGC spot price following the annual RPP surrender is typical. This occurs as liable entities secure supply to meet their next RPP compliance obligations. In Q3 and Q4 each year, the LGC spot price typically drops and stabilises. This occurs as companies realise sufficient LGCs are available, or they have secured sufficient LGCs to meet their compliance obligations.Â 

Following the expanded CIS announcement on 23 November 2023, the LGC spot price dropped to $45.50 before recovering quickly to above the preannouncement price. 

In summary two primary factors:
- Expectations of supply increased given the CIS announcement. This led to a temporary decrease in the futures price.
- Seasonal variation following the annual RRP surrender.
