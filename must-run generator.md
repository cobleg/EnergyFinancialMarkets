# Definition
A `must-run generator` must keep running under specified conditions. An example is a coal-fuelled generator, which is typically designed as a base-load electricity generator will incur substantial inefficiencies if the steam boilers are not kept at a optimal temperature.

There can be a variety of issues requiring `must-run generation` such as:
- system inertia requirements
- hydro-power which must release water required for irrigation or environmental purposes.
