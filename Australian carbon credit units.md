# Introduction 
Australian carbon credit units are instruments derived from the [Emissions Reduction Fund](http://www.cleanenergyregulator.gov.au/ERF/About-the-Emissions-Reduction-Fund), a voluntary scheme that aims to provide incentives for a range of organisations and individuals to adopt new practices and technologies to reduce their carbon dioxide equivalent emissions.

The credits are produced via activities that are eligible under the scheme. One #ACCU is earned for each tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2-e) stored or avoided by a project. ACCUs can be sold to generate income, either to the government through a carbon abatement contract, or in the secondary market.

ACCUs provide a source of revenue that can assist industries fund reductions in carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. The Australian Government acts as a market maker for ACCUs. This will operate via the [Australian carbon exchange](http://www.cleanenergyregulator.gov.au/Infohub/Markets/australian-carbon-exchange)
