Scope 1 emissions are defined within the context of the Safeguard Mechanism.
> The Safeguard Mechanism applies to facilities that emit more than 100,000 $tCO_2$-e of covered emissions in a financial year (the Safeguard threshold). This extends to businesses across a broad range of industry sectors, including electricity generation, mining, oil and gas extraction, manufacturing, transport, and waste.

> Covered emissions are defined as scope 1 emissions, including direct emissions from fugitive emissions and emissions from fuel combustion, waste disposal, and industrial processes such as cement and steel making.

> Some scope 1 emissions are not covered by the Safeguard Mechanism. These include:
- legacy emissions from the operation of a landfill facility (that is, emissions from waste deposited at the landfill before 1 July 2016)
- emissions which occur in the Greater Sunrise special regime area
- emissions from the operation of a grid-connected electricity generator in a year covered by the sectoral baseline
- emissions not covered under theÂ [National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (Measurement) Determination 2008](https://www.cleanenergyregulator.gov.au/NGER/Pages/Legislation/Measurement-Determination.aspx).
