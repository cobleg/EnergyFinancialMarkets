# Overview
Game theory provides a framework in which to analyse, understand and predict the outcomes of agents interacting with each other. For example, economics includes many examples of applied game theory to analyse situations such as [[coordination failure]]. 

A [[game]] is a framework for analysing the strategic interactions between agents (AKA players).  A game consists of:
- `Players`: a collection of decision-makers otherwise known as agents
- `Information states`: of each player at each decision time
- `Feasible moves`: decisions, actions, plays that each player can choose to make in each possible information state
- `Procedure` : for determining how the move choices of all the players collectively determine the possible outcomes of the game
- `Preferences`: of the individual players over possible outcomes, typically measured by a [[utility function]] or [[payoff function]].

Each player forms a plan, which can be either a pure [[strategy]],  a mixed  [[strategy]], or a behavioural [[strategy]]. 

# Application to energy markets
Energy markets involve a few types of players (e.g. consumers, suppliers, market makers, government etc). Interactions between players generate complex market dynamics. For example, a low-cost electricity supplier could decide to partially withdraw offers to supply electricity. During a period of high demand and restricted supply, this would likely cause a price spike. The electricity supplier would benefit from increased revenue while incurring les
