The chart above confirms that domestic gas prices did not keep up with LNG netback prices in 2021. Primary reasons given by the ACCC are:
- LNG export prices increased at a faster rate. Domestic gas prices did increase, but not at the same rate.
- The concerns expressed by the ACCC in previous reports about LNG exporter non-compliance with the Commonwealth Government Heads of Agreement may have had a chilling effect on price increases.
- Higher domestic price elicited by gas supply offers.
- Demand destruction with Incitec-Pivot announcing it was shutting down its production plant due to the inability to negotiate a competitively priced gas contract.
