# Introduction
The National Electricity Market, #NEM, is a pool market operated by the Australian Energy Market Operator, #AEMO [About the National Electricity Market (NEM)](https://www.aemo.com.au/energy-systems/electricity/national-electricity-market-nem/about-the-national-electricity-market-nem). 

The NEM interconnects five regional market jurisdictions – Queensland, New South Wales (including the Australian Capital Territory), Victoria, South Australia, and Tasmania.

The transport of electricity from generators to consumers is facilitated through a ‘pool’, or spot market, where the output from all generators is aggregated and scheduled at five-minute intervals to meet demand.

The pool is not a physical thing, but a set of procedures that AEMO manages in line with the [National Electricity Law](https://www.legislation.sa.gov.au/LZ/C/A/NATIONAL%20ELECTRICITY%20(SOUTH%20AUSTRALIA)%20ACT%201996.aspx) and [National Electricity Rules](http://www.aemc.gov.au/Energy-Rules/National-electricity-rules/Current-Rules).

# Demand and supply of electricity
The balance between the demand and supply of electricity determines the wholesale electricity price. This induces a derived demand for fuels such as #coal, #gas and #diesel in so-called thermal electricity generation. 

Over time, there has been a gradual substitution of fuel-based electricity generation for renewable electricity generation, mainly solar and wind power. 

This has created interesting and at times, highly volatile, wholesale electricity prices. One interesting aspect of these market dynamics are the apparent increasing dependence on the [[Australian domestic gas market]]. This is in part driven by the reduction in demand for coal, suppressing the [[Australian domestic coal market]].
